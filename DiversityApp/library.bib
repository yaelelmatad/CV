abstract = {We introduce the notion of "Janus balance" (J), defined as the dimensionless ratio of work to transfer an amphiphilic colloidal particle (a "Janus particle") from the oil-water interface into the oil phase, normalized by the work needed to move it into the water phase. The J value can be calculated simply from the interfacial contact angle and the geometry of Janus particles, without the need to know the interfacial energy. It is demonstrated that Janus particles of the same chemical composition but different geometries will have the highest adsorption energy when J = 1. Even for particles of homogeneous chemical makeup, the Janus balance concept can be applied when considering the contact angle hysteresis in desorbing the particle from equilibrium into the water or oil phase. The Janus balance concept may enable predictions of how a Janus particle behaves with respect to efficiency and function as a solid surfactant, as the Janus balance of solid surfactants is the analog of the classical hydrophile-lipophile balance of small surfactant molecules.},

A slowing-down of the dynamics is observed close to the bottom of the packing with a correlation length of 5-6d. In this perturbed zone, the self-intermediate scattering function, decaying slower than exponentially, suggests the existence of a heterogeneous dynamics. A characteristic time scale of the dynamics depending on the distance from the bottom of the packing is extracted. Our numerical results open the way to a systematic study of the influence of external driving force and of boundary conditions on the heterogeneity of the dynamics of granular packings under gravity.},

abstract = {We present a method to evaluate the activation energy of viscous flow in the dense gas-like model that adopts the concepts of both the kinetic theory and the rate theory. The activation energy is assumed to be the sum of the fraction 1/3 z e  of the excess energy and the fraction 1/3 z p  of the excess pressure of a liquid. The first fraction is motivated by an early work of the rate theory, and the second one is an analogy of that. This is made under speculation that the contribution from the valence electrons to the shear viscosity may be partly ignored for liquid metals. The model involves three parameters: one corrects the diameter of a molecule, and the other two,  z e  and  z p , in the respective fractions measure deviation from the isotropic picture for forces acting on the molecules in a real liquid. Applying the present model for the entire fluid region of Ar, it is found that the term of the excess energy determines the main feature of the shear viscosity in the liquid region, while the term of the excess pressure plays a crucial role in the description of the feature of the shear viscosity rapidly increasing in the supercritical high-density region. The results are compared with the experimental data as well as those obtained from a recent work of elaborate molecular dynamics evaluation. The present model is also applied to liquids Cu and Ag, and the values for the parameters obtained in the model are compared with those for Ar.},

abstract = {Volume and enthalpy relaxation studies of amorphous Se have been performed in the glass transition region by mercury dilatometry and differential scanning calorimetry. For simple temperature jump experiments, as well as for more complex thermal history the volume and enthalpy relaxation data can be described by a single set of kinetic parameters for Tool-Naraynaswamy-Moynihan (TNM) model [$\Delta$ h * / R  = 42.8 kK, ln( A TNM /s) = −133]. Slightly different non-linearity and non-exponentiality parameter were found for volume [ x  = 0.42,  $\beta$  = 0.58] and enthalpy [ x  = 0.52,  $\beta$  = 0.65] relaxation data. Similar results were obtained also for Adam-Gibbs-Scherer (AGS) model. The activation energy of viscous flow in the glass transition range is identical with the effective activation energy for relaxation process. A self-consistent data evaluation shows that at moderate departure from equilibrium, volume and enthalpy in amorphous selenium relax in the same way as expressed by TNM and AGS models. Both volume and enthalpy change can be interpreted within the same fictive temperature concept.},

In a recent experimental study, the foam volume responded dramatically when the rate of temperature-increase varied from 5 to 15 °C/min. This observation indicates that an enhanced temperature-increase rate (a natural consequence of the increased processing rate experienced as a result of the transition to oxy-fuel firing) may exert a substantial influence on glass foaming in advanced glass-melting furnaces. This paper attributes this effect to the change of mode of foam formation as a response to an increased rate of heating.},

@article{Capaccioli2008,
abstract = {doi: 10.1021/jp802097u When a liquid is cooled below its melting temperature, if crystallization is avoided, it forms a glass. This phenomenon, called glass transition, is characterized by a marked increase of viscosity, about 14 orders of magnitude, in a narrow temperature interval. The microscopic mechanism behind the glass transition is still poorly understood. However, recently, great advances have been made in the identification of cooperative rearranging regions, or dynamical heterogeneities, i.e., domains of the liquid whose relaxation is highly correlated. The growth of the size of these domains is now believed to be the driving mechanism for the increase of the viscosity. Recently a tool to quantify the size of these domains has been proposed. We apply this tool to a wide class of materials to investigate the correlation between the size of the heterogeneities and their configurational entropy, i.e., the number of states accessible to a correlated domain. We find that the relaxation time of a given system, apart from a material dependent prefactor, is a universal function of the configurational entropy of a correlated domain. As a consequence, we find that, at the glass transition temperature, the size of the domains and the configurational entropy per unit volume are anticorrelated, as originally predicted by the Adam−Gibbs theory. Finally, we use our data to extract some exponents defined in the framework of the random first-order theory, a recent quantitative theory of the glass transition.},

We also discuss the precise predictions of MCT concerning the statistical ensemble and microscopic dynamics dependence of these multipoint correlation functions. These predictions are compared to simulations of model fragile and strong glass-forming liquids. Overall, MCT fares quite well in the fragile case, in particular, explaining the observed crucial role of the statistical ensemble and microscopic dynamics, while MCT predictions do not seem to hold in the strong case. KCMs provide a simplified framework for understanding how these multipoint correlation functions may encode dynamic correlations in glassy materials.

We reexamine this relationship by analyzing dynamical fluctuations in two atomistic glass formers and two theoretical models. We introduce quantitative statistical indicators which show that the dynamics of individual particles cannot be predicted on the basis of the propensity or by any structural indicator. However, the spatial structure of the propensity field does have predictive power for the spatial correlations associated with dynamic heterogeneity. Our results suggest that the quest for a connection between the static and dynamic properties of glass formers at the particle level is in vain, but they demonstrate that such a connection does exist on larger length scales.},

E 52, 4134 (1995) is studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations. In a previous paper f. Varnik, l. Bocquet, j.-l. Barrat, and l. Berthier, phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 095702 (2003) it was shown that, at temperatures below the glass transition temperature, T-g, the model exhibits shear banding under imposed shear. It was also suggested that this behavior is closely related to the existence of a (static) yield stress (under applied stress, the system does not flow until the stress sigma exceeds a threshold value sigma(y)). A thorough analysis of the static yield stress is presented via simulations under imposed stress. Furthermore, using steady shear simulations, the effect of physical aging, shear rate and temperature on the stress-strain relation is investigated. In particular, we find that the stress at the yield point (the ''peak''-value of the stress-strain curve) exhibits a logarithmic dependence both on the imposed shear rate and on the ''age'' of the system in qualitative agreement with experiments on amorphous polymers c. Ho huu and t. Vu- khanh, theoretical and applied fracture mechanics 40, 75 (2003); l. E. Govaert, h. G. H. Van melick, and h. E. H. Meijer, polymer 42, 1271 (2001) and on metallic glasses w. L.

In addition to the very observation of the yield stress which is an important feature seen in experiments on complex systems like pastes, dense colloidal suspensions f. Da cruz, f. Chevoir, d. Bonn, and p. Coussot, phys. Rev. E 66, 051305 (2002) and foams g. Debregeas, h. Tabuteau, and j.-m. Di meglio, phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 178305 (2001), further links between our model and soft glassy materials are found. An example is the existence of hysteresis loops in the system response to a varying imposed stress. Finally, we measure the static yield stress for our model and study its dependence on temperature. We find that for temperatures far below the mode coupling critical temperature of the model (T-c=0.435 in Lennard-Jones units), sigma(y) decreases slowly upon heating followed by a stronger decrease as T-c is approached. We discuss the reliability of results on the static yield stress and give a criterion for its validity in terms of the time scales relevant to the problem. (c) 2004 american institute of physics.},

abstract = {We study theoretically and numerically a family of multipoint dynamic susceptibilities that quantify the strength and characteristic length scales of dynamic heterogeneities in glass-forming materials. We use general theoretical arguments (fluctuation-dissipation relations and symmetries of relevant dynamical field theories) to relate the sensitivity of averaged two-time correlators to temperature and density to spontaneous fluctuations of the local dynamics. Our theoretical results are then compared to molecular dynamics simulations of the Newtonian, Brownian, and Monte Carlo dynamics of two representative glass-forming liquids, a fragile binary Lennard-Jones mixture, and a model for the strong glass-former silica. We justify in detail the claim made by Berthier et al. Science 310, 1797 (2005) that the temperature dependence of correlation functions allows one to extract useful information on dynamic length scales in glassy systems. We also discuss some subtle issues associated with the choice of microscopic dynamics and of statistical ensemble through conserved quantities, which are found to play an important role in determining dynamic correlations.},

abstract = {Understanding glass formation is a challenge, because the existence of a true glass state, distinct from liquid and solid, remains elusive: Glasses are liquids that have become too viscous to flow. An old idea, as yet unproven experimentally, is that the dynamics becomes sluggish as the glass transition approaches, because increasingly larger regions of the material have to move simultaneously to allow flow. We introduce new multipoint dynamical susceptibilities to estimate quantitatively the size of these regions and provide direct experimental evidence that the glass formation of molecular liquids and colloidal suspensions is accompanied by growing dynamic correlation length scales.},

E 52, 4134 (1995) is studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations. In a previous paper f. Varnik, l. Bocquet, j.-l. Barrat, and l. Berthier, phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 095702 (2003) it was shown that, at temperatures below the glass transition temperature, T-g, the model exhibits shear banding under imposed shear. It was also suggested that this behavior is closely related to the existence of a (static) yield stress (under applied stress, the system does not flow until the stress sigma exceeds a threshold value sigma(y)). A thorough analysis of the static yield stress is presented via simulations under imposed stress. Furthermore, using steady shear simulations, the effect of physical aging, shear rate and temperature on the stress-strain relation is investigated. In particular, we find that the stress at the yield point (the ''peak''-value of the stress-strain curve) exhibits a logarithmic dependence both on the imposed shear rate and on the ''age'' of the system in qualitative agreement with experiments on amorphous polymers c.

Finally, we measure the static yield stress for our model and study its dependence on temperature. We find that for temperatures far below the mode coupling critical temperature of the model (T-c=0.435 in Lennard-Jones units), sigma(y) decreases slowly upon heating followed by a stronger decrease as T-c is approached. We discuss the reliability of results on the static yield stress and give a criterion for its validity in terms of the time scales relevant to the problem. (c) 2004 american institute of physics.},

abstract = {We study aging dynamics in two non-disordered spin models with multi-spin interactions, following a sudden quench to low temperature. The models are relevant to the physics of supercooled liquids. Their low temperature dynamics resemble those of kinetically constrained models, and obey dynamical scaling, controlled by zero-temperature critical points. Dynamics in both models are thermally activated, resulting in multi-stage relaxation towards equilibrium. We study several two-time correlation and response functions. We find that equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relations are generically not satisfied during the aging regime, but deviations from them are well described by fluctuation-dissipation ratios, as found numerically in supercooled liquids. These ratios are purely dynamic objects, containing information about the nature of relaxation in the models. They are non-universal, and can even be negative as a result of activated dynamics. Thus, effective temperatures are not well-defined in these models.},

Other significant nonlinear effects are also demonstrated, such as the enhancement with increasing force of the probe's fluctuations away from the average path, a phenomenon known in other contexts as giant diffusivity. We show that these results can be explained analytically by a continuous-time random walk approximation where there is decoupling between persistence and exchange times for local displacements of the probe. This decoupling is due to dynamic heterogeneity in the glassy system, which also leads to bimodal distributions of probe particle displacements.

By considering a dynamical analog of the free energy, evidence was found for phase coexistence between active and inactive regions of space time, and it was suggested that this phenomenon underlies the glass transition. Here we develop these ideas further by investigating in detail the one-dimensional Fredrickson-Andersen (FA) model, in which the active and inactive phases originate in the reducibility of the dynamics. We illustrate the phase coexistence by considering the distributions of mesoscopic space-time observables. We show how the analogy with phase coexistence can be strengthened by breaking microscopic reversibility in the FA model, leading to a nonequilibrium theory in the directed percolation universality class.},

Our results show that a correlation between spatially extended low frequency modes and high propensity regions does not imply that relaxational dynamics originates in extended soft modes.

abstract = {Understanding glass formation is a challenge, because the existence of a true glass state, distinct from liquid and solid, remains elusive: Glasses are liquids that have become too viscous to flow. An old idea, as yet unproven experimentally, is that the dynamics becomes sluggish as the glass transition approaches, because increasingly larger regions of the material have to move simultaneously to allow flow. We introduce new multipoint dynamical susceptibilities to estimate quantitatively the size of these regions and provide direct experimental evidence that the glass formation of molecular liquids and colloidal suspensions is accompanied by growing dynamic correlation length scales.

At normal pressure, supercooled water spontaneously freezes below the homogeneous nucleation temperature, TH = 235 K. Upon heating, the two forms of Amorphous Solid Water (ASW), LDA (Low Density Amorphous Ice) and HDA (High Density Amorphous Ice), crystallise above TX = 150 K. As a consequence, up to now no experiment has been able to explore the properties of liquid water in this very interesting temperature range between 150 and 235 K. We present nanosecond-time-scale measurements of local rotational and translational dynamics of interfacial, non-crystalline, water from 77 to 280 K. These experimental dynamic results are combined with calorimetric and diffraction data to show that after exhibiting a glass transition at 165 K, interfacial water experiences a first-order liquid-liquid transition at 240 K from a low-density to a high-density liquid. This is the first direct evidence of the existence of a liquid-liquid transition involving water.},

Unlike ordinary fusion, systems of grains, foams and colloids jam and cease to flow under conditions that still remain unknown. Here, we quantify jamming using a thermodynamic approach by accounting for the structural ageing and the shear-induced compressibility2 of dry sand. Specifically, the jamming threshold is defined using a non-thermal temperature3 that measures the 'fluffiness' of a granular mixture. The thermodynamic model, cast in terms of pressure, temperature and free volume, also successfully predicts the entropic data of five molecular glasses. Notably, the predicted configurational entropy averts the Kauzmann paradox4---an unresolved crisis where the configurational entropy becomes negative---entirely. Without any free parameters, the proposed equation-of-state also governs the mechanism of shear banding and the associated features of shear softening5, 6 and thickness invariance2, 7.},

Due to the low dielectric strength and the tendency to crystallize at elevated temperatures, a detailed shape analysis of the loss profile from the glass transition temperature Tg to approximately 1.2 Tg is not available for the neat glass former. Assessing the origin of the different temperature dependencies of translational and rotational motions in supercooled liquids and its possible connection to heterogeneity requires this knowledge regarding the possible changes in the relaxation-time distribution across the 100 s-100 ns relaxation-time range. This note provides this information for o-terphenyl on the basis of a master curve representation: time-temperature superposition applies with a constant stretching exponent of beta=0.5 in the range of interest.},

abstract = {The susceptibility spectra of ten molecular glass formers are completely interpolated by an extension of the generalized gamma distribution of correlation times. The data cover at least 15 decades in frequency and the interpolation includes both alpha peak and excess wing. It is shown that the line shape parameters and the time constant of the alpha relaxation are related to each other. Master curves are identified by a scaling procedure that involves only three parameters, namely, the glass transition temperature Tg, the fragility m, and the excess wing exponent at Tg. This holds independent of whether a further secondary relaxation peak is present or not. Above a crossover temperature Tx this unique evolution of the line shape parameters breaks down, and a crossover to a simple peak susceptibility without excess wing is observed. Here, the frequency-temperature superposition principle holds in good approximation up to temperatures well above the melting point. It turns out that the crossover coincides with the temperature at which the low-temperature Vogel-Fulcher law starts to fail upon heating. Thus, the so-called Stickel temperature gets a more physical meaning as it marks a qualitative change in the evolution of the susceptibility spectra of glass formers. Moreover, the interrelation of the line shape parameters can explain why the \{"\}Nagel scaling\{"\} works in some approximation. Our study demonstrates that the excess wing in molecular glass formers is a secondary relaxation, which is linked to the alpha process in a unique way. },

abstract = {Abstract: We combine old, unpublished data on ionic liquids containing quaternary ammonium cations with new data on salts of aromatic cations containing a variety of anions, to demonstrate the existence for ionic liquids of an unexpectedly wide range of liquid fragilities. The pattern is one now familiar for other liquids. Here, the pattern is important in determining the relative fluid properties at ambient temperatures. We find that the optimization of ionic liquids for ambient temperature applications requiring low-vapor-pressure fluid phases involves the proper interplay of both cohesive energy and fragility factors. The cohesive energy is discussed in terms of the coulomb and van der Waals contributions to the attractive part of the pair potential. On the basis of the relation between the glass-transition temperature and the molar volume for salts with less-polarizable anions, we find evidence for a broad minimum in the ionic liquid cohesive energy at an internuclear separation of ca. 0.6 nm. This minimum lies between those of the B and TFSI- anions for the small quaternary ammonium cations of this study. The minimum is expected to be narrower and less well-defined for salts with polarizable anions. The relation of fluidity to conductance is considered in terms of a Walden plot that is shown to provide a useful basis for organizing the observations on ionic liquids and solutions. Low vapor pressure and ideal Walden products are intimately related.},

abstract = {For nonpolymeric supercooled liquids, the empirical correlation m = 56Tg DeltaCp(Tg)/DeltaHm provides a reliable means of correlating dynamic and thermodynamic variables. The dynamics are characterized by the fragility or steepness index m and the glass transition temperature Tg, while thermodynamics enter in terms of the heat capacity step DeltaCp at Tg and the melting enthalpy DeltaHm. The combination of the above correlation with the 23 rule for the Tg/Tm ratio yields an expression, m = 40DeltaCp(Tg)/DeltaSm, which was rationalized as the correlation of the thermodynamic and kinetic fragilities. Defining a thermodynamic fragility via DeltaCp(Tg)/DeltaSm also reveals that the slopes in Kauzmann's original DeltaS(T)/DeltaSm versus T/Tm plot reflect the fragility concept [Chem. Rev. 43, 219 (1948)], so long as Tm/Tg = 1.5. For the many liquids whose excess heat capacity is a hyperbolic function of temperature, we deduce that the fragility cannot exceed m = 170, unless the Tg/Tm = 2/3 rule breaks down.},

abstract = {Abstract: The heat capacities of glassy and liquid toluene and ethylbenzene were measured with an adiabatic calorimeter. Both samples were doped with about 10\% of benzene to suppress crystallization. The effects of the doping were corrected for by assuming the additivity of the heat capacities of toluene (or ethylbenzene) and benzene. The configurational entropies of several glass-forming liquids, including toluene and ethylbenzene, were calculated as functions of temperature from their heat-capacity data. For these calculations, the vibrational heat capacities were determined by the least-squares fitting of the Debye and Einstein functions to the experimental values using auxiliary spectroscopic data from the literature. The size of cooperative rearranging region (CRR), which was first conceived by Adam and Gibbs, was calculated from the configurational entropy in a simplifying approximation that neglects distribution of CRR size and internal entropy of CRR. For all of the systems examined, the size of CRR increases with decreasing temperature and is frozen-in at four to eight molecules per region at the glass-transition temperature.},

abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the empirical detection and characterization of power laws is made difficult by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution. In particular, standard methods such as least-squares fitting are known to produce systematically biased estimates of parameters for power-law distributions and should not be used in most circumstances. Here we describe statistical techniques for making accurate parameter estimates for power-law data, based on maximum likelihood methods and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. We also show how to tell whether the data follow a power-law distribution at all, defining quantitative measures that indicate when the power law is a reasonable fit to the data and when it is not. We demonstrate these methods by applying them to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines. Each of the data sets has been conjectured previously to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

The Stokes-shift correlation function displays a relaxation time dispersion of considerable magnitude and the optical line width changes systematically along the solvation coordinate. The solvent dynamics in the viscous regime is compared with the rotational behavior of the solute and with the dielectric relaxation of the ionic liquid. Among the different quantities derived from the dielectric experiments, the relaxation of the macroscopic electric field, i.e., the modulus M(t), matches best the solvent response C(t) regarding time scale and stretching exponent. Many other properties are reminiscent of the behavior of polar molecular liquids which lack the ionic character.},

The logarithm of the primitive [alpha]-relaxation time at Tg,log[[tau]0(Tg)], calculated according to the coupling model from the observed [alpha]-relaxation at Tg, is exactly correlated with the Kohlrausch exponent. A similar, although inexact, correlation between log[[tau][beta](Tg)] and (1-n) is thus expected and found.

We study dynamical heterogeneity and growing dynamical length scales in two kinetically constrained models, namely, the one- and two-vacancy assisted triangular lattice gases. One of the models is a strong glassformer and the other is a fragile glassformer. Both exhibit heterogeneous dynamics with broadly distributed time scales as seen in the distribution of persistence times. We show that the Stokes-Einstein relation is violated, to a greater degree in the fragile glassformer, and show how this violation is related to dynamic heterogeneity. We extract dynamical length scales from structure factors of mobile particles and show, quan-titatively, the growth of this length scale as density increases. We comment on how the scaling of lengths and times in these models relates to that in facilitated spin models of glasses.

abstract = {We consider the probability distribution for fluctuations in dynamical action and similar quantities related to dynamic heterogeneity. We argue that the so-called glass transition is a manifestation of low action tails in these distributions where the entropy of trajectory space is subextensive in time. These low action tails are a consequence of dynamic heterogeneity and an indication of phase coexistence in trajectory space. The glass transition, where the system falls out of equilibrium, is then an order-disorder phenomenon in space-time occurring at a temperature T(g), which is a weak function of measurement time. We illustrate our perspective ideas with facilitated lattice models and note how these ideas apply more generally.},

abstract = {The disordered nature of glass-forming melts gives rise to non-Arrhenius and non-exponential behaviour of their dynamics. With respect to the microscopic details involved in the structural relaxation, these materials have remained an unsolved puzzle for over a century. The observation of spatial heterogeneity regarding the dynamics provides an important step towards understanding the relation between the macroscopic properties of soft condensed matter and the molecular mechanisms involved. On the other hand, dynamic heterogeneity is the source of several new questions: What is the length scale and persistence time associated with such clusters of relaxation time? What is the signature of heterogeneity at high temperatures and in the glassy state? How do these features depend on the particular material and on the correlation function used for probing these heterogeneities? This work attempts to review the various approaches to heterogeneous dynamics and the generally accepted results, as well as some controversial issues. Undoubtedly, heterogeneity has provoked a number of novel experimental techniques targeted at studying glass-forming liquids at the molecular level. It will be emphasized that the picture of heterogeneity is a requirement for rationalizing an increasing number of experimental observations rather than just an alternative model for the dynamics of molecules.},

It is a debated question whether a correct description of such phenomenon requires the emergence of a large correlation length. We prove rigorous bounds between length and time scales implying the growth of a properly defined length when the relaxation time increases. Our results are valid in a rather general setting, which covers finite-dimensional and mean field systems.As an illustration, we discuss the Glauber (heat bath) dynamics of p-spin glass models on random regular graphs. We present the first proof that a model of this type undergoes a purely dynamical phase transition not accompanied by any thermodynamic singularity.},

abstract = {At low temperatures, proteins exist in a glassy state, a state that has no conformational flexibility and shows no biological functions. In a hydrated protein, at temperatures \{gtrsim\}220 K, this flexibility is restored, and the protein is able to sample more conformational substates, thus becoming biologically functional. This dynamical transition of protein is believed to be triggered by its strong coupling with the hydration water, which also shows a similar dynamic transition. Here we demonstrate experimentally that this sudden switch in dynamic behavior of the hydration water on lysozyme occurs precisely at 220 K and can be described as a fragile-to-strong dynamic crossover. At the fragile-to-strong dynamic crossover, the structure of hydration water makes a transition from predominantly high-density (more fluid state) to low-density (less fluid state) forms derived from the existence of the second critical point at an elevated pressure.

order-disorder phenomenon in the d + 1 dimensions of space time. By considering a dynamical 
analog of the free energy, evidence was found for phase coexistence between active and inactive 
regions of space time, and it was suggested that this phenomenon underlies the glass transition. Here 
we develop these ideas further by investigating in detail the one-dimensional Fredrickson-Andersen 
FA model, in which the active and inactive phases originate in the reducibility of the dynamics. We 
illustrate the phase coexistence by considering the distributions of mesoscopic space-time 
observables. We show how the analogy with phase coexistence can be strengthened by breaking 
microscopic reversibility in the FA model, leading to a nonequilibrium theory in the directed

Data for a second glass former, cresol-phthalein-dimethylether, having a molecular structure very close to that of PDE, were also analysed.

abstract = {We use a standard Monte Carlo algorithm to study the slow dynamics of a binary Lennard-Jones glass-forming mixture at low temperature. We find that the Monte Carlo approach is by far the most efficient way to simulate a stochastic dynamics since the relaxation is about 10 times faster than in Brownian dynamics and about 30 times faster than in stochastic dynamics. Moreover, the average dynamical behaviour of the system is in quantitative agreement with that obtained using Newtonian dynamics, apart from at very short times where thermal vibrations are suppressed. We show, however, that dynamic fluctuations quantified by four-point dynamic susceptibilities do retain a dependence on the microscopic dynamics, as recently predicted theoretically.},

abstract = { An adiabatic calorimeter for a vapor-deposited sample was newly constructed, and thermal properties of amorphous butyronitrile were studied in detail. The cryostat was cooled down to 10 K with a built-in refrigerator. The sample vapor was introduced through a filling tube into a calorimeter cell. During the deposition, the temperature of the cell was kept as low as possible by making mechanical-thermal contact with a refrigerant tank, while that of the tube was kept higher than the dew point of the vapor. A special device was made in order to minimize the heat flow from the tube to the cell. Butyronitrile vapor was deposited at 67 and 40 K in the first and the second experiments, respectively. Another kind of vitreous sample was prepared by rapidly cooling the liquid in comparison with the vapor-deposited vitreous samples. Heat capacities of the samples were measured in the temperature range from 15 to 175 K with an imprecision of about $\backslash$pm0.5\%. Both the vapor-deposited and the liquid-quenched samples exhibited heat capacity jump characteristics of the glass transition of the same temperature, viz. 97 K. A large heat evolution amounting to 1.3 kJ mol-1 in total was observed in the case of vapor-deposited solid over a wide range of temperatures between the deposition temperature and the glass transition temperature. The microscopic picture for this heat evolution is discussed on the basis of the concept of the cluster structure for a liquid.},

abstract = {The thermodynamic formalism allows one to access the chaotic properties of equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium systems, by deriving those from a dynamical partition function. The definition that has been given for this partition function within the framework of discrete time Markov chains was not suitable for continuous time Markov dynamics. Here we propose another interpretation of the definition that allows us to apply the thermodynamic formalism to continuous time.
We also generalize the formalism --a dynamical Gibbs ensemble construction-- to a whole family of observables and their associated large deviation functions. This allows us to make the connection between the thermodynamic formalism and the observable involved in the much-studied fluctuation theorem.
We illustrate our approach on various physical systems: random walks, exclusion processes, an Ising model and the contact process. In the latter cases, we identify a signature of the occurrence of dynamical phase transitions. We show that this signature can already be unravelled using the simplest dynamical ensemble one could define, based on the number of configuration changes a system has undergone over an asymptotically large time window.},

abstract = {We use recently introduced three-point dynamic susceptibilities to obtain an experimental determination of the temperature evolution of the number of molecules, Ncorr, that are dynamically correlated during the structural relaxation of supercooled liquids. We first discuss in detail the physical content of three-point functions that relate the sensitivity of the averaged two-time dynamics to external control parameters (such as temperature or density), as well as their connection to the more standard four-point dynamic susceptibility associated with dynamical heterogeneities. We then demonstrate that these functions can be experimentally determined with a good precision. We gather available data to obtain the temperature dependence of Ncorr for a large number of supercooled liquids over a wide range of relaxation timescales from the glass transition up to the onset of slow dynamics. We find that Ncorr systematically grows when approaching the glass transition. It does so in a modest manner close to the glass transition, which is consistent with an activation-based picture of the dynamics in glassforming materials. For higher temperatures, there appears to be a regime where Ncorr behaves as a power-law of the relaxation time. Finally, we find that the dynamic response to density, while being smaller than the dynamic response to temperature, behaves similarly, in agreement with theoretical expectations.},

abstract = {We present depolarized light scattering data of the glass former toluene as obtained from tandem Fabry-Perot interferometry and Raman scattering covering a frequency range 0.5 GHz < v < 5000 GHz. A large temperature interval of the (supercooled) liquid (T-g=117 K < T < 295 K) as well as of the glass (7 K < T < 117 K) is measured. Testing the scaling laws of idealized mode coupling theory (MCT) we find that MCT provides a satisfying interpolation up to the fluid regime (T/T-g=2.5) and a critical temperature T(c)congruent to 153 K is extracted. Deviations from the high-temperature MCT laws below T-c can be identified by constructing a master curve for the alpha-process. The deviations are attributed to spectral contributions from the high-frequency wing of the alpha-process and/or of the slow beta-process which appear apparently only below T-c. A comparison with dielectric spectroscopy data, exhibiting a strong beta-process, confirms this. Furthermore, we carry out a phenomenological analysis which assumes additivity of the susceptibility of alpha-process and fast dynamics. This approach allows us to single out the fast dynamics spectrum and to determine the nonergodicity parameter f. Whereas 1-f(T) is essentially constant above 160 K, a sharp decrease is observed below 160 K. This decrease stops at T=T-g and only a weak temperature dependence survives below T-g. Thus, the fast dynamics changes its characteristics at T-c and T-g. We speculate on the possibility of an ideal glass state exhibiting no relaxation any longer, and finally we comment on reasons for the large scatter of T-c data reported for some glass formers so far.},

abstract = {When a liquid is cooled below its melting temperature, if crystallization is avoided, it forms a glass. This phenomenon, called glass transition, is characterized by a marked increase of viscosity, about 14 orders of magnitude, in a narrow temperature interval. The microscopic mechanism behind the glass transition is still poorly understood. However, recently, great advances have been made in the identification of cooperative rearranging regions, or dynamical heterogeneities, i.e. domains of the liquid whose relaxation is highly correlated. The growth of the size of these domains is now believed to be the driving mechanism for the increase of the viscosity. Recently a tool to quantify the size of these domains has been proposed. We apply this tool to a wide class of materials to investigate the correlation between the size of the heterogeneities and their configurational entropy, i.e. the number of states accessible to a correlated domain. We find that the relaxation time of a given system, apart from a material dependent pre-factor, is a universal function of the configurational entropy of a correlated domain. As a consequence, we find that at the glass transition temperature, the size of the domains and the configurational entropy per unit volume are anti-correlated, as originally predicted by the Adam-Gibbs theory. Finally, we use our data to extract some exponents defined in the framework of the Random First Order Theory, a recent quantitative theory of the glass transition.},

abstract = {Abstract: We report dielectric relaxation studies of aqueous solutions of two water-like molecules, hydrazine and hydrogen peroxide, in the neighborhood of their glass transition temperatures, Tg. These solutions behave in a rather simple manner, reminiscent of the diols and diamines of which they are the limiting cases. Their relaxations near Tg are more nearly exponential than in most other cases, and they show essentially no secondary relaxations. Supercooled hydrazine solutions are the more stable. At the composition 20 mol \% N2H4, the liquid exhibits precise time-temperature-superposition (TTS) behavior. At higher N2H4 contents, a weak deviation from TTS appears. The temperature dependence of the relaxation time follows the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) equation, and the strength parameter, D, is similar to that of glycerol, a liquid of intermediate fragility. The VFT divergence temperature, T0, lies close to the Kauzmann temperature, TK, determined earlier from calorimetric studies implying that the thermodynamic and kinetic measures of fragility are very similar. Tg values assessed from T(=100s) agree well with observed calorimetric, Tg's. Extrapolation of the relaxation time behavior to pure water would imply a Tg for water of 135-140 K; however, the dielectric behavior of amorphous solid water in the temperature range 130-160 K is completely different from that of the solutions showing no sign of the loss peak exhibited by all the solutions. Based on the solution behavior, water controversially must either remain glassy up until the temperature of crystallization or be an almost ideally strong liquid above 136 K. Having shown elsewhere how this implies glassy character up to LDA crystallization and a Tg above 160 K, we now examine the implications for water structure reorganization on dissolution of solutes, certain glycols excepted. It appears that the water in these solutions behaves like ice III rather than ice I.},

abstract = {Abstract: The dielectric behavior of the supercooled aqueous solutions of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylene glycol (EG), and methanol (MeOH) has been examined in the frequency range 106-10-3 Hz and in the xm range of 0.19-0.40, 0.25-0.85, and 0.50-0.85, respectively, where xm is the mole fraction of the second component. Differential scanning calorimetric measurements have also been carried out on the samples. At temperatures above the glass transition temperature (Tg), it was found that the Hevriliak-Negami relaxation function is appropriate to describe the data. The apparent distribution in relaxation times increases with increasing water content and also on lowering the temperature. But at temperatures just above Tg, an Arrhenius branch of considerable polarization and with an activation energy of \~{}21.5 kJ/mol separates out to continue to the sub-Tg region, which more or less disappears around xm = 0.33 in DMSO solutions and around xm = 0.50 in EG solutions. It is suggested that the complexes of 2:1 (in DMSO solutions) and 1:1 (in EG solutions) are present in the liquid that are thermolabile and exist in an undissociated state only near Tg, and the sub-Tg process is due to the relaxation of water molecules. No evidence of complex formation is found in MeOH solutions.},

As a liquid is cooled far below its melting point, dynamics in some regions of the sample can be orders of magnitude faster than dynamics in other regions only a few nanometers away. In this review, the experimental work that characterizes this heterogeneity is described. in particular, the following questions are addressed: How large are the heterogeneities? How long do they last? How much do dynamics vary between the fastest and slowest regions? Why do these heterogeneities arise? The answers to these questions influence practical applications of glass-forming materials, including polymers, metallic glasses, and pharmaceuticals.},

The majority of models aimed at explaining this unusual dielectric behavior associate the prominent Debye process with structural relaxation, viscous flow, and the glass transition. We perform dielectric and calorimetric studies of glass-forming mixtures of 2-ethylhexylamine and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol across the entire composition range. The kinetic glass transition temperature derived from the large dielectric Debye peak decreases, whereas that of the much smaller and asymmetrically broadened peak increases upon addition of amine. Only the latter feature coincides with the calorimetric glass transition results, implying that molecular structure and dielectric polarization fluctuate on time scales that can differ by orders of magitude in many hydrogen-bonding liquids.},

abstract = {Dielectric relaxation measurements were carried out on sorbitol as a function of pressure at various temperatures. 
The almost linear dependence of the structural relaxation times on pressure yields values for the activation 
volume. In light of results for xylitol and glycerol, the activation volume is found to be an increasing function 
of molecular size. Because the pressure coefficients of the glass temperature for these polyalcohols are all 
equal, their fragilities should parallel their respective activation volumes. This expectation is borne out by 
experimental measurements at ambient pressure. Analysis of the volume dependence of the relaxation times 
reveals that temperature, rather than density, dominates the structural relaxation of sorbitol. At frequencies 
higher than the structural relaxation, a secondary process is observed. The weaker pressure sensitivity of the 
latter effects better resolution of the two peaks at high pressures. The relaxation time for the secondary process 
is consistent with a calculation from the coupling model based on identification of the secondary process as 
the precursor to the highly cooperative structural relaxation.},

abstract = {Abstract: Crystallization processes in indomethacin can be observed below Tg leading to different forms depending on the thermal treatment: a rapid and deep quench below Tg leads to the metastable -phase and a slow cooling close to Tg gives rise to the stable -phase. To understand this atypical behavior, we have studied the molecular mobility of the amorphous and crystalline forms of indomethacin by dielectric relaxation and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Two relaxations were detected in the glassy state obtained from the deeply quenched liquid. One, also present in the -phase, was attributed to local rotations. The other one, of very low amplitude, was attributed to the Johari-Goldstein relaxation. The results allowed to discuss the relationship between these two relaxation processes and the crystallization properties of amorphous indomethacin.},

abstract = {An amorphous solid of 1, 3, 5-tri--naphthylbenzene (TNB) was prepared by grinding the crystalline sample with a vibrating mill. Heat capacities of the ground amorphous solid (GAS), liquid-quenched glass (LQG) and crystal of TNB were measured with an adiabatic calorimeter in the temperature range 10 - 330 K for the GAS and 5 - 370 K for the LQG and crystal. The heat capacities of the LQG and GAS were 0.5 - 1\% larger than that of the crystal. The heat capacity of the GAS agreed with that of the LQG between 30 and 330 K but was 1 - 4\% larger than that of the LQG below 30 K. The heat capacity difference in the low-temperature region can be attributed to the difference in low-energy excitation which is known as a universal property of amorphous materials. A glass transition occurred at 342 K for the LQG. For the GAS, however, a large exothermic effect due to crystallization appeared from 315 K, which is 25 K lower than of the LQG. The configurational enthalpy of GAS determined from the enthalpy of crystallization was much larger than that of the LQG. This result indicates that the structure of the GAS is much more disordered and strained than that of the LQG.},

abstract = {We review the use of kinetically constrained models (KCMs) for the study of dynamics in glassy systems. The characteristic feature of KCMs is that they have trivial, often non-interacting, equilibrium behaviour but interesting slow dynamics due to restrictions on the allowed transitions between configurations. The basic question which KCMs ask is therefore how much glassy physics can be understood without an underlying 'equilibrium glass transition'. After a brief review of glassy phenomenology, we describe the main model classes, which include spin-facilitated (Ising) models, constrained lattice gases, models inspired by cellular structures such as soap froths, models obtained via mappings from interacting systems without constraints, and finally related models such as urn, oscillator, tiling and needle models. We then describe the broad range of techniques that have been applied to KCMs, including exact solutions, adiabatic approximations, projection and mode-coupling techniques, diagrammatic approaches and mappings to quantum systems or effective models. Finally, we give a survey of the known results for the dynamics of KCMs both in and out of equilibrium, including topics such as relaxation time divergences and dynamical transitions, nonlinear relaxation, ageing and effective temperatures, cooperativity and dynamical heterogeneities, and finally non-equilibrium stationary states generated by external driving. We conclude with a discussion of open questions and possibilities for future work.},

Likewise, systems where the excess wing evolved to a well-resolved b-peak showed that the timescale of the b-process was strongly related to that of the a-peak.

abstract = {Supercooled liquids and dense colloidal suspensions exhibit anomalous behaviour known as 'spatially heterogeneous dynamics' (SHD), which becomes increasingly pronounced as the system approaches the glass transition(1-3). Recently, the observation of SHD in confined granular packings under slow shear near the onset of jamming has bolstered speculation that the two transitions are related(4-6). Here, we report measurements of SHD in a system of air-driven granular beads, as a function of both density and effective temperature. On approach to jamming, the dynamics becomes progressively slower and more spatially heterogeneous. The rapid growth of timescales and dynamical length scales characterizing the heterogeneities can be described both by mode-coupling theory(7) and the Vogel - Tammann Fulcher (VTF) equation(8), such as in glass-forming liquids. The value of the control variable at the VTF transition coincides with point J (refs 9,10), the random close-packed jamming density at which all motion ceases, in analogy to a zero-temperature ideal glass transition. Our findings demonstrate further universality of the jamming concept and provide a significant step forward in the quest for a unified theory of jamming in disparate systems.},

The model gives a reasonably accurate fit to the temperature dependence of Sc for all 17 liquids, providing something of a resolution to the Kauzmann paradox. Not unexpectedly, however, the model falls somewhat short of matching precisely the temperature dependence of the excess liquid heat capacity [Delta]CP. The parameter n obtained from the fits shows a positive correlation with the number of conformational degrees of freedom f assessed from the structures of the molecules, providing some insight into the sources of the configurational entropy at the molecular level. In addition, it is found that the parameter n controls the shape of the Sc vs T curve, providing, via the Adam-Gibbs equation, some correlation between the molecular structures and the kinetic fragilities m of the liquids.},

In contrast to polymer blends, concentration fluctuations have no measurable broadening effect on the shape of C(t). Instead, L(log ) becomes narrower with increasing temperature and affects differently C(t) and C2(t) for the zinc halide mixture. Despite local homogeneity in the thermodynamically ideal mixture, ZnBr2 with the higher glass transition temperature (Tg = 395 K) was found to dominate the primary -relaxation in the symmetric binary mixture. In the framework of two-fluid models, the distribution and the temperature dependence of support rigid microheterogeneities on the order of 2 nm.

F is related to the steepness parameter m via F\&unknown;0.079m. A continuous transition from the master curve of non-polymer systems to the one of polymers is found if molecular weight is systematically increased. Tx is found to be close to the critical temperature Tc reported from analyses of the dynamic susceptibility by mode coupling theory. It is tentatively concluded that the magnitude of the interval between Tx and Tg defines the degree of fragility. At T>Tx deviations from the master curves occur, and the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation provides a very good fit to highest temperatures. The two master curves at T<Tx can be interpolated by several formulae.},

from an expanded coil to a compact native state. Here we study an analogous
direct freezing transition from an expanded coil to a compact crystallite for a
simple flexible homopolymer. Wang-Landau sampling is used to construct the 1D
density of states for square-well chains of length 128. Analysis within both
the micro-canonical and canonical ensembles shows that, for a chain with
sufficiently short-range interactions, the usual polymer collapse transition is
preempted by a direct freezing or "folding" transition. A 2D free-energy
landscape, built via subsequent multi-canonical sampling, reveals a dominant
folding pathway over a single free-energy barrier. This barrier separates a
high entropy ensemble of unfolded states from a low entropy set of crystallite
states and the transition proceeds via the formation of a transition-state
folding nucleus. Despite the non-unique homopolymer ground state, the
thermodynamics of this direct freezing transition are identical to the
thermodynamics of two-state protein folding. The model chain satisfies the
van't Hoff calorimetric criterion for two-state folding and an Arrhenius
analysis of the folding/unfolding free energy barrier yields a Chevron plot

abstract = {Nearest neighbor interactions have been incorporated into novel equations that describe diffusion processes during phase separation and ordering. None of the elements of the model are new, but the gestalt is overdue. Nearest neighbor interactions are included in the free energy of a binary alloy, then the chemical potentials of the two species are derived from this free energy. The diffusion fluxes are driven by the chemical activities, which are given by the chemical potentials. This results in fourth-order difference equations that describe the motion of atoms during phase separation or ordering. Calculations using these equations describe the expected evolution of microstructures, which have often been depicted only with cartoons. In the unstable spinodal region, perturbations grow exponentially with time until the compositions reach the phase boundary compositions, and then the structures coarsen slowly. In the meta-stable region between the spinodal and the phase boundary, composition fluctuations that are large enough generate phase separation by a nucleation process. In the single-phase region outside the two-phase field, there is critical slowing down. Far away from the critical region, the equations become standard diffusion equations, where the diffusion process is driven only by entropy. Numerical solutions describe the temporal evolution of microstructures during spinodal decomposition, precipitation, and ordering. The propagation of instability fronts in the spinodal region have been observed, and their velocities have been determined. More complex interactions between atomic sites are expected to change only the details but not the essential character of the behavior observed in this model. Based on universality, it is expected that method can be applied to many situations where there is an interaction between the volume elements.},

continuous slowing down or by a first order polyamorphous phase transition. The
second scenario has so far always been observed below the melting point where
it interfered with crystalline nucleation. We report the first observation of
the liquid-glass transition by a first order phase transition above the melting
point. The observation was made in a molecular dynamics simulation of a
one-component system with a model metallic pair potential. This is also the
first observation of a simple monatomic ideal glass former -- a liquid that
avoids crystallization at any cooling rate. Besides its conceptual importance,
this result indicates a possibility of existence of metallic ideal glass

on the definition of an ensemble of trajectories weighted according to their
chaoticity, the Lyapunov weighted path ensemble. This ensemble of trajectories
is sampled using algorithms borrowed from transition path sampling, a method
originally developed to study rare transitions between long-lived states. We
demonstrate our approach by applying it to several systems with numbers of
degrees of freedom ranging from one to several hundred and in all cases the
algorithm found rare pathways with atypical chaoticity. For a double-well dimer
embedded in a solvent, which can be viewed as simple model for an isomerizing

the origin of glassy dynamics. Despite having trivial thermodynamic properties,
their dynamics slows down dramatically at low temperatures while displaying
dynamical heterogeneity as seen in glass forming supercooled liquids. This
dynamics has its origin in an ergodic-nonergodic first-order phase transition
between phases of distinct dynamical "activity". This is a "space-time"
transition as it corresponds to a singular change in ensembles of trajectories
of the dynamics rather than ensembles of configurations. Here we extend these
ideas to driven glassy systems by considering KCMs driven into non-equilibrium
steady states through non-conservative forces. By classifying trajectories
through their entropy production we prove that driven KCMs also display an
analogous first-order space-time transition between dynamical phases of finite

to model the Brownian motion more realistically than the usual one based on the
classical Langevin equation, in that it takes into account also the retarding
effects due to hydrodynamic back-flow, i.e. the added mass and the Basset
memory drag. We provide the analytical expressions of the correlation functions
(both for the random force and the particle velocity) and of the mean squared
particle displacement. The random force has been shown to be represented by a
superposition of the usual white noise with a "fractional" noise. The velocity
correlation function is no longer expressed by a simple exponential but
exhibits a slower decay, proportional to t\^{}\{-3/2\} for long times, which indeed
is more realistic. Finally, the mean squared displacement is shown to maintain,
for sufficiently long times, the linear behaviour which is typical of normal
diffusion, with the same diffusion coefficient of the classical case. However,
the Basset history force induces a retarding effect in the establishing of the
linear behaviour, which in some cases could appear as a manifestation of
anomalous diffusion to be correctly interpreted in experimental measurements.}},

the model, the main contribution to enthalpy of evaporation comes from the
processes in the surface layer. It is suggested that adsorption from solutions,

Correlated diffusion measurements in the film show that the presence of bulk fluid changes the nature of the longitudinal coupling diffusion coefficient from logarithmic to algebraic dependence of 1/ s , where  s  is the distance between the two particles. This result, along with the scaling exponents, suggests that the phase separation takes place through the Brownian coagulation process.},

as a function of age for a repulsive colloidal glass undergoing structural

relaxation time, which increases exponentially with sample age at short times.
The yield stress varies logarithmically with time in the arrested state,
consistent with recent simulation results, whereas the yield strain is nearly
constant in this regime. Strikingly, the frequency dependence at fixed times
can be rescaled onto a master curve, implying a simple connection between the

Accordingly, the methods must cancel these signs properly in order to sample
this eigenfunction faithfully. We present a simple procedure to solve this sign

algorithms as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. Next, we
computed \$\backslash lambda\_2\$ for a model of an interacting gas trapped by a harmonic

efficiency of the Metropolis algorithm as a function of temperature and the
maximum allowable step size \$\backslash Delta\$. Based on the \$\backslash lambda\_2\$ criterion, we
found for the Ising models that small lattices appear to give an adequate

optimal efficiency that the acceptance ratio does not. The cases studied also

time that has been reported for small sized reverse micelles. In our finite
sized model, the two spins at the two end cells are oriented in the opposite
directions, to mimic the effects of surface that in real system fixes water
orientation in the opposite directions. This produces opposite polarizations to
propagate inside from the surface and to produce bulk-like condition at the

we solve the model numerically with Glauber spin flip dynamics (and also with
Metropolis single-spin flip Monte Carlo algorithm). We show that model nicely
reproduces many of the features observed in experiments. Due to the destructive
interference among correlations that propagate from the surface to the core,
one of the rotational relaxation time components decays faster than the bulk.
In general, the relaxation of spins is non-exponential due to the interplay
between various interactions. In the limit of strong coupling between the spins

amorphous packing known as "random close packing" (RCP). This structure is of
interest as a model for the arrangement of molecules in simple liquids and

particles with a resolution of each particle position to better than 0.02
particle diameters. While the arrangement of the particles satisfies multiple
criteria for being random, we also observe a small fraction (less than 3\%) of
tiny crystallites (4 particles or fewer). These regions pack slightly better
and are thus associated with locally higher densities. The structure factor of
our sample at long length scales is non-zero, \$S(0) \backslash approx 0.049\$, suggesting
that there are long wavelength density fluctuations in our sample, perhaps due
to the tiny crystallites. Our results suggest that experimentally realizable
RCP systems may be different from simulated RCP systems, in particular, with
the presence of these long wavelength density fluctuations.},

@article{Castelnovo2010,
abstract = {Using the mapping of the Fokker-Planck description of classical stochastic
dynamics onto a quantum Hamiltonian, we argue that a dynamical glass transition
in the former must have a precise definition in terms of a quantum phase
transition in the latter. At the dynamical level, the transition corresponds to
a collapse of the excitation spectrum at a critical point. At the static level,
the transition affects the ground state wavefunction: while in some cases it
could be picked up by the expectation value of a local operator, in others the
order may be non-local, and impossible to be determined with any local probe.
Here we propose instead to use concepts from quantum information theory that
are not centered around local order parameters, such as fidelity and
entanglement measures. We show that for systems derived from the mapping of
classical stochastic dynamics, singularities in the fidelity susceptibility
translate directly into singularities in the heat capacity of the classical
system. In classical glassy systems with an extensive number of metastable
states, we find that the prefactor of the area law term in the entanglement
entropy jumps across the transition. We also discuss how entanglement measures
can be used to detect a growing correlation length that diverges at the
transition. Finally, we illustrate how static order can be hidden in systems
with a macroscopically large number of degenerate equilibrium states by
constructing a three dimensional lattice gauge model with only short-range
interactions but with a finite temperature continuous phase transition into a
massively degenerate phase.},

abstract = {We analyze the slow, glassy structural relaxation as measured through
collective and tagged-particle density correlation functions obtained from
Brownian dynamics simulations for a polydisperse system of quasi-hard spheres

Asymptotic analyses show good agreement for the collective dynamics when
polydispersity effects are taken into account in a multi-component calculation,
but qualitative disagreement at small \$q\$ when the system is treated as
effectively monodisperse. The origin of the different small-\$q\$ behaviour is
attributed to the interplay between interdiffusion processes and structural
relaxation. Numerical solutions of the MCT equations are obtained taking
properly binned partial static structure factors from the simulations as input.
Accounting for a shift in the critical density, the collective density
correlation functions are well described by the theory at all densities
investigated in the simulations, with quantitative agreement best around the
maxima of the static structure factor, and worst around its minima. A
parameter-free comparison of the tagged-particle dynamics however reveals large
quantiative errors for small wave numbers that are connected to the well-known
decoupling of self-diffusion from structural relaxation and to dynamical
heterogeneities. While deviations from MCT behaviour are clearly seen in the
tagged-particle quantities for densities close to and on the liquid side of the
MCT glass transition, no such deviations are seen in the collective dynamics.},

@article{Barbosa2010,
abstract = {We study the molecular correlations in a lattice model of a solution of a
low-solubility solute, with emphasis on how the thermodynamics is reflected in
the correlation functions. The model is treated in Bethe-Guggenheim
approximation, which is exact on a Bethe lattice (Cayley tree). The solution
properties are obtained in the limit of infinite dilution of the solute. With
\$h\_\{11\}(r)\$, \$h\_\{12\}(r)\$, and \$h\_\{22\}(r)\$ the three pair correlation functions
as functions of the separation \$r\$ (subscripts 1 and 2 referring to solvent and
solute, respectively), we find for \$r \backslash geq 2\$ lattice steps that
\$h\_\{22\}(r)/h\_\{12\}(r) \backslash equiv h\_\{12\}(r)/h\_\{11\}(r)\$. This illustrates a general
theorem that holds in the asymptotic limit of infinite \$r\$. The three
correlation functions share a common exponential decay length (correlation
length), but when the solubility of the solute is low the amplitude of the
decay of \$h\_\{22\}(r)\$ is much greater than that of \$h\_\{12\}(r)\$, which in turn is
much greater than that of \$h\_\{11\}(r)\$. As a consequence the amplitude of the
decay of \$h\_\{22\}(r)\$ is enormously greater than that of \$h\_\{11\}(r)\$. The
effective solute-solute attraction then remains discernible at distances at
which the solvent molecules are essentially no longer correlated, as found in
similar circumstances in an earlier model. The second osmotic virial
coefficient is large and negative, as expected. We find that the
solvent-mediated part \$W(r)\$ of the potential of mean force between solutes,
evaluated at contact, \$r=1\$, is related in this model to the Gibbs free energy
of solvation at fixed pressure, \$\backslash Delta G\_p\^{}*\$, by \$(Z/2) W(1) + \backslash Delta G\_p\^{}*
\backslash equiv p v\_0\$, where \$Z\$ is the coordination number of the lattice, \$p\$ the
pressure, and \$v\_0\$ the volume of the cell associated with each lattice site. A
large, positive \$\backslash Delta G\_p\^{}*\$ associated with the low solubility is thus
reflected in a strong attraction (large negative \$W\$ at contact), which is the
major contributor to the second osmotic virial coefficient. In this model, the
low solubility (large positive \$\backslash Delta G\_p\^{}*\$) is due partly to an unfavorable
enthalpy of solvation and partly to an unfavorable solvation entropy, unlike in
the hydrophobic effect, where the enthalpy of solvation itself favors high
solubility, but is overweighed by the unfavorable solvation entropy.},

explained by a Random Matrix benchmark where these correlations are discarded.
We then present a first attempt to find a link between the softest modes of the
covariance matrix during a certain "quiet" time interval and the spatial
structure of the rearrangement event that ends this quiet period. The motion
during these cracks is indeed well explained by the soft modes of the dynamics
before the crack, but the number of cracks preceded by a "quiet" period
strongly reduces when the system unjams, questioning the relevance of a
description in terms of modes close to the jamming transition, at least for
frictional grains.},

In the wet granular media with small liquid content, the liquid forms a bridge at each contact point, which induces a two-body cohesive force due to the surface tension. As the liquid content increases, some liquid bridges merge, and more than two grains interact through a single liquid cluster. In our model, the cohesive force acts between the grains connected by a liquid-gas interface. As the liquid content increases, the number of grains that interact through the liquid increases, but the liquid-gas interface may decrease when liquid clusters are formed. Due to this competition, our model shows that the shear stress has a maximum as a function of the liquid content.},

abstract = {The surface chemistry and structure of iron-bearing silicate glasses have been modified by means of heat-treatment around the glass transition temperature under different gaseous media at ambient pressure. When the glasses are heat-treated in atmospheric air, oxidation of Fe 2+  to Fe 3+  occurs, which leads to outward diffusion (OD) of divalent cations (primarily Mg 2+ ), i.e., diffusion from the interior of the glass to the surface, and thereby, to formation of an oxide surface nano-layer. In contrast, when the glasses are heat-treated in H 2 /N 2  gas containing 10 vol.\% H 2 , reduction of Fe 3+  to Fe 2+  occurs due to both the permeation and reducing ability of H 2 . In this case, OD of divalent ions also occurs, and hence, an oxide surface layer forms. However, such outward diffusion differs from that induced by the iron oxidation in terms of physical origin. The former is due to incorporation of the N 3−  ions in the network and their strong attraction to the modifying ions, whereas the latter is due to the requirement of the charge neutrality. The role of N 3−  in driving OD is verified by the composition profile of the surface layer of the glass treated in pure N 2  gas. The OD exerts pronounced impacts on some properties such as hardness, chemical durability, and surface wettability.},

In particular, we define two overlap order parameters, which quantify the correlation between particle configurations at different times, based on a Voronoi construction and the persistence in the resulting cells and nearest neighbors. Temporal fluctuations in the decay of the persistent area and bond order parameters define two alternative dynamic four-point susceptibilities A() and B(), well suited for characterizing spatially heterogeneous dynamics. These are analogous to the standard four-point dynamic susceptibility 4(l,), but where the space dependence is fixed uniquely by topology rather than by discretionary choice of cutoff function. While these three susceptibilities yield characteristic time scales that are somewhat different, they give domain sizes for the dynamical heterogeneities that are in good agreement and that diverge on approach to jamming.},

For a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS), the corresponding FDT is shown to involve in the correlation function a variable that is conjugate with respect to entropy. By splitting up entropy production into one of the system and one of the medium, it is shown that for systems with a genuine equilibrium state the FDT of the NESS differs from its equilibrium form by an additive term involving total entropy production. A related variant of the FDT not requiring explicit knowledge of the stationary state is particularly useful for coupled Langevin systems. The a priori surprising freedom apparently involved in different forms of the FDT in a NESS is clarified.},

The fluctuation–dissipation relation (FDR) relates the two in equilibrium, a fact used regularly, for example, to infer mechanical properties of soft matter from the fluctuations in light scattering3. In slowly evolving non-equilibrium systems, such as ageing spin4, 5 and structural glasses6, 7, sheared soft matter8 and active matter9, a form of FDR has been proposed in which an effective temperature10, Teff, replaces the usual temperature, and universal behaviour is found in mean-field models10, 11 and simulations6, 7, 8, 12. Thus far, only experiments on spin-glasses13 and liquid crystals14 have succeeded in accessing the strong-ageing regime, where Teff>T and possible scaling behaviour are expected. Here we test these ideas through measurements of local dielectric response and polarization noise in an ageing structural glass, polyvinyl acetate. The relaxation-time spectrum, as measured by noise, is compressed, and by response, is stretched, relative to equilibrium, requiring an effective temperature with a scaling behaviour similar to that of certain mean-field spin-glass models.},

Here we demonstrate real-time feedback control7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 of the motion of a single atom trapped in an optical cavity. Individual probe photons carrying information about the atomic position13, 14 activate a dipole laser that steers the atom on timescales 70 times shorter than the atom’s oscillation period in the trap. Depending on the specific implementation, the trapping time is increased by a factor of more than four owing to feedback cooling, which can remove almost all the kinetic energy of the atom in a quarter of an oscillation period12.

This makes it difficult to deduce the properties of homogeneous phases with standard density imaging, which averages over different phases. Moreover, important properties such as superfluid density are inaccessible by standard imaging techniques, and will remain inaccessible even when systems of interest are successfully simulated.

abstract = {All hard, convex shapes are conjectured by Ulam to pack more densely than spheres1, which have a maximum packing fraction of $\phi$ = $\pi$/√18 ≈ 0.7405. Simple lattice packings of many shapes easily surpass this packing fraction2, 3. For regular tetrahedra, this conjecture was shown to be true only very recently; an ordered arrangement was obtained via geometric construction with $\phi$ = 0.7786 (ref. 4), which was subsequently compressed numerically to $\phi$ = 0.7820 (ref. 5), while compressing with different initial conditions led to $\phi$ = 0.8230 (ref. 6). Here we show that tetrahedra pack even more densely, and in a completely unexpected way. Following a conceptually different approach, using thermodynamic computer simulations that allow the system to evolve naturally towards high-density states, we observe that a fluid of hard tetrahedra undergoes a first-order phase transition to a dodecagonal quasicrystal7, 8, 9, 10, which can be compressed to a packing fraction of $\phi$ = 0.8324. By compressing a crystalline approximant of the quasicrystal, the highest packing fraction we obtain is $\phi$ = 0.8503. If quasicrystal formation is suppressed, the system remains disordered, jams and compresses to $\phi$ = 0.7858. Jamming and crystallization are both preceded by an entropy-driven transition from a simple fluid of independent tetrahedra to a complex fluid characterized by tetrahedra arranged in densely packed local motifs of pentagonal dipyramids that form a percolating network at the transition. The quasicrystal that we report represents the first example of a quasicrystal formed from hard or non-spherical particles. Our results demonstrate that particle shape and entropy can produce highly complex, ordered structures.},

abstract = {In general, the relatively modest expansion experienced by most materials on heating is caused by increasing anharmonic vibrational amplitudes of the constituent atoms, ions or molecules1. This phenomenon is called positive thermal expansion (PTE) and usually occurs along all three crystallographic axes. In very rare cases, structural peculiarities may give rise either to anomalously large PTE, or to negative thermal expansion (NTE, when lattice dimensions shrink with heating)2, 3, 4. As NTE and unusually large PTE are extremely uncommon for molecular solids, mechanisms that might give rise to such phenomena are poorly understood. Here we show that the packing arrangement of a simple dumbbell-shaped organic molecule, coupled with its intermolecular interactions, facilitates a cooperative mechanical response of the three-dimensional framework to changes in temperature. A series of detailed structural determinations at 15-K intervals has allowed us to visualize the process at the molecular level. The underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a three-dimensional (3D) folding trellis and results in exceptionally large and reversible uniaxial PTE and biaxial NTE of the crystal. Understanding such mechanisms is highly desirable for the future design of sensitive thermomechanical actuators.},

When the fluctuation-dissipation theorem of second kind is not satisfied, the dynamics is irreversible, i.e. detailed balance is violated. We show that the entropy production rate for this system should include the power injected by "memory forces". With this additional contribution, the fluctuation relation is fairly verified in simulations. Both dynamics with inertia and overdamped dynamics yield the same expression for this additional power. The role of "memory forces" within the fluctuation-dissipation relation of first kind is also discussed.},

abstract = {In a recent quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiment on water confined in a Portland cement paste, we find that this 3D confined water shows a dynamic crossover phenomenon at TL = 227 +- 5 K. The DSC heat-flow scan upon cooling and an independent measurement of specific heat at constant pressure of confined water in silica gel show a prominent peak at the same temperature. We show in this paper that this type of behavior is common to many other glassy liquids, which also show the crossover temperature in coincidence with the temperature of a small specific heat peak. We also demonstrate with MD simulations that the dynamic crossover phenomenon in confined water is an intrinsic property of bulk water, and is not due to the confinement effect. Recently, an extended version of the mode coupling theory (MCT) including the hopping effect was developed. This theory shows that, instead of a structural arrest transition at TC predicted by the idealized MCT, a fragile-to-strong dynamic crossover phenomenon takes place instead at TC, confirming both the experimental and the numerical results. The coherent and incoherent a relaxation times can be scaled with the calculated viscosity, showing the same crossover phenomenon. We thus demonstrated with experiments, simulations and theory that a genuine change of dynamical behavior of both water and many glassy liquids happens at the crossover temperature TL, which is 10-30\% higher than the calorimetric glass transition temperature Tg.},

This paper is devoted to this question, which can be usefully envisaged by means of macroscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics. From the pioneer work of De Donder on chemical reactions and with other authors along the 20th century, the question is tackled under an historical point of view. A special attention is paid about the notions of frequency dependent complex heat capacity and entropy production due to irreversible processes occurring during an experiment. This phenomenological approach based on thermodynamics, not widely spread in the literature of calorimetry, could open significant perspectives on the study of macro-systems undergoing physico-chemical transformations probed by dynamic calorimetry.},

abstract = {The temperature dependence of viscosity of glass-forming liquids near the glass transition temperature  T g  (at which viscosity  $\eta$  = 10 12  Pa s) is given by the fragility index  inlMMLBox , which is unique for each material. Therefore,  m  should not depend on the type of the model functions used to describe the viscous behavior. Using this condition, we modified the three-fitting-parameter viscosity equations, i.e., Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann (VFT) and Avramov equations, into one-fitting parameter equations. Both modified equations contain the glass transition temperature  T g  and fragility index  m  as material constants, allowing a direct comparison of the modified equations. Experimental viscosity data are required over a wide temperature range to determine the three-fitting parameters of the VFT and Avramov equations, restricting their applicability. However, the modified equations developed here provide a convenient method of modeling the temperature dependence of viscosity by using the experimentally accessible parameters  T g  and  m . The modified one-fitting parameter equations were used to analyze viscous behavior of a number of oxide and organic glass-forming liquids. Based on this analysis, it was concluded that the modified Avramov equation describes the experimental data better than the modified VFT equation. Taking into account that the modified VFT equation predicts infinite viscosity at a finite temperature  T 0 , while the modified Avramov equation predicts a continuous increase in viscosity with a decrease in temperature down to the absolute zero, the obtained results may indicate that the oxide and organic super-cooled liquids do not experience dynamic divergence when they are cooled below the glass transition temperature. Strong physical interpretations are developed for all of the parameters used in present equations to model the temperature dependence of viscosity, giving an important improvement over earlier phenomenological models.},

The effects of the doping were corrected for by assuming the additivity of the heat capacities of toluene (or ethylbenzene) and benzene. The configurational entropies of several glass-forming liquids, including toluene and ethylbenzene, were calculated as functions of temperature from their heat-capacity data. For these calculations, the vibrational heat capacities were determined by the least-squares fitting of the Debye and Einstein functions to the experimental values using auxiliary spectroscopic data from the literature. The size of cooperative rearranging region (CRR), which was first conceived by Adam and Gibbs, was calculated from the configurational entropy in a simplifying approximation that neglects distribution of CRR size and internal entropy of CRR. For all of the systems examined, the size of CRR increases with decreasing temperature and is frozen-in at four to eight molecules per region at the glass-transition temperature.},

This crossover is studied by density correlation functions, nonergodic parameters, mean square displacement, and nonlinear dynamic susceptibility. Our finding is qualitatively consistent with the results of recent numerical and theoretical studies on various spatially heterogeneous systems. Furthermore, we show that slow dynamics is surprisingly rich and sensitive to obstacle configurations.

However, by comparing diffusion of binding particles in a static and a dynamic chain network, we demonstrate that binding properties do have a much stronger influence on particles in the static chain network than in the dynamic chain network: fluctuations of the chromatin fiber network weaken the effect of binding affinities on the diffusional transport of particles, i.e. in the presence of chromatin fluctuations the transport of small binding proteins is less anomalous.

Phase transitions have been reported between low-energy magnetized QSSs and large-energy unexpected, antiferromagnetic-like, QSSs with low magnetization. This issue is addressed here in the Vlasov N-[?] limit. It is argued that the time-asymptotic states emerging in the Vlasov limit can be related to simple generic time-asymptotic forms for the force field. The proposed picture unveils the nature of the out-of-equilibrium phase transitions reported for the ferromagnetic HMF: this is a bifurcation point connecting an effective integrable Vlasov one-particle time-asymptotic dynamics to a partly ergodic one which means a brutal open-up of the Vlasov one-particle phase space. Illustration is given by investigating the time-asymptotic value of the magnetization at the phase transition, under the assumption of a sufficiently rapid time-asymptotic decay of the transient force field.},

Special attention is paid to check separately the two underlying fundamental statements into which the considered theory can be recast, namely i) a single relation between the invariants of stress and strain rate tensors and ii) the alignment between these tensors. Interestingly, the first prediction is fairly well verified over more than four decades of small strain rate, from the surface rapid flow to the quasi-static creep phase, where it is usually believed to fail because of jamming. On the other hand, the alignment between stress and strain rate tensors is shown to fail over the whole flow, what yields an apparent violation of the visco-plastic rheology when applied without care. In the quasi-static phase, the particularly large misalignment is conjectured to be related to transient dilatancy effects.},

abstract = {Glass formation in colloidal suspensions has many of the hallmarks of glass formation in molecular materials1, 2, 3, 4, 5. For hard-sphere colloids, which interact only as a result of excluded volume, phase behaviour is controlled by volume fraction, $\phi$; an increase in $\phi$ drives the system towards its glassy state, analogously to a decrease in temperature, T, in molecular systems. When $\phi$ increases above $\phi$* ≈ 0.53, the viscosity starts to increase significantly, and the system eventually moves out of equilibrium at the glass transition, $\phi$g ≈ 0.58, where particle crowding greatly restricts structural relaxation1, 2, 3, 4. The large particle size makes it possible to study both structure and dynamics with light scattering1 and imaging3, 4; colloidal suspensions have therefore provided considerable insight into the glass transition. However, hard-sphere colloidal suspensions do not exhibit the same diversity of behaviour as molecular glasses. This is highlighted by the wide variation in behaviour observed for the viscosity or structural relaxation time, $\tau$$\alpha$, when the glassy state is approached in supercooled molecular liquids5. This variation is characterized by the unifying concept of fragility5, which has spurred the search for a ‘universal’ description of dynamic arrest in glass-forming liquids. For ‘fragile’ liquids, $\tau$$\alpha$ is highly sensitive to changes in T, whereas non-fragile, or ‘strong’, liquids show a much lower T sensitivity. In contrast, hard-sphere colloidal suspensions are restricted to fragile behaviour, as determined by their $\phi$ dependence1, 6, ultimately limiting their utility in the study of the glass transition. Here we show that deformable colloidal particles, when studied through their concentration dependence at fixed temperature, do exhibit the same variation in fragility as that observed in the T dependence of molecular liquids at fixed volume. Their fragility is dictated by elastic properties on the scale of individual colloidal particles. Furthermore, we find an equivalent effect in molecular systems, where elasticity directly reflects fragility. Colloidal suspensions may thus provide new insight into glass formation in molecular systems.},

Nearly all glass-forming liquids show secondary relaxations, high-frequency dynamical modes of structural reconfiguration seemingly distinct from the primary alpha relaxations. We show that accounting for driving-force fluctuations and the diversity of reconfiguring shapes in the random first-order transition theory yields a new dynamical process that shares many of the features ascribed to secondary relaxations. Whereas primary relaxation takes place through activated events involving compact regions, secondary relaxation is governed by more ramified, string-like or percolation-like clusters of particles. These secondary relaxations generate a low free-energy tail on the distribution of activation barriers, which becomes more prominent with increasing temperature. The activation barrier distributions of the two processes merge near the dynamical-crossover temperature Tc, where the secondary process ultimately becomes the dominant mode of structural relaxation. These string-like reconfigurations are seen to smooth the transition at Tc between high-temperature collisional dynamics and activated events.},

The monomeric homing endonuclease I-AniI cleaves with high sequence specificity in the centre of a 20-base-pair (bp) DNA target site, with the amino (N)-terminal domain of the enzyme making extensive binding interactions with the left (-) side of the target site and the similarly structured carboxy (C)-terminal domain interacting with the right (+) side. Here we show that, despite the approximate twofold symmetry of the enzyme-DNA complex, there is almost complete segregation of interactions responsible for substrate binding to the (-) side of the interface and interactions responsible for transition-state stabilization to the (+) side. Although single base-pair substitutions throughout the entire DNA target site reduce catalytic efficiency, mutations in the (-) DNA half-site almost exclusively increase the dissociation constant (K(D)) and the Michaelis constant under single-turnover conditions (K(M)*), and those in the (+) half-site primarily decrease the turnover number (k(cat)*). The reduction of activity produced by mutations on the (-) side, but not mutations on the (+) side, can be suppressed by tethering the substrate to the endonuclease displayed on the surface of yeast. This dramatic asymmetry in the use of enzyme-substrate binding energy for catalysis has direct relevance to the redesign of endonucleases to cleave genomic target sites for gene therapy and other applications. Computationally redesigned enzymes that achieve new specificities on the (-) side do so by modulating K(M)*, whereas redesigns with altered specificities on the (+) side modulate k(cat)*. Our results illustrate how classical enzymology and modern protein design can each inform the other.},

This is done for a certain class of initial quantum states which is supported by static linear response and typicality arguments. We directly relate the broadening to some current auto-correlation function at finite times. Our result is not limited to diffusive behavior, however, in that case it yields a generalized Einstein relation. These findings facilitate the approximation of diffusion constants/conductivities on the basis of current auto-correlation functions at finite times for finite systems. Pursuing this, we quantitatively confirm the magnetization diffusion constant in a spin chain which was recently found from non-equilibrium bath scenarios.},

The study is made for oxide as well as for polymeric glasses by calculating  R c  for SiO 2 , B 2 O 3 , O-terphenyl, 2-methylpentane, glycerol and ethanol. The variations of  R c  with the reduced ideal glass transition temperature ( T K / T m ) as well as with the ratio of specific heat and entropy differences ( inlMMLBox ) at the melting temperature ( T m ) have been analyzed, where  T K  is the ideal glass transition temperature. It is found that material having a large value of the reduced ideal glass transition temperature ( T K / T m ) results a lower value of  R c . It is also found that  R c  decreases with increasing  inlMMLBox . Attempt has also been made to study the glass forming ability of materials on the basis of reduced residual entropy ( $\Delta$ S R /$\Delta$ S m ) and  ( T g - T K )/ T m , where  T g  is the glass transition temperature and it is found that the material having a lower reduced residual entropy ( $\Delta$ S R /$\Delta$ S m ) requires a lower  R c  to convert into a glassy structure.

abstract = {The unification of relativity and thermodynamics has been a subject of considerable debate over the past 100 years. The reasons for this are twofold. First, thermodynamic variables are non-local quantities and therefore single out a preferred class of hyperplanes in spacetime. Second, there exist different ways of defining heat and work in relativistic systems and all of them seem equally plausible. These ambiguities have led, for example, to various proposals for the Lorentz-transformation law of temperature. However, traditional 'isochronous' formulations of relativistic thermodynamics are neither theoretically satisfactory nor experimentally feasible. Here, we demonstrate how these deficiencies can be resolved by defining thermodynamic quantities with respect to the backward-lightcone of an observation event. This approach yields new predictions that are, in principle, testable and allows for a straightforward extension of thermodynamics to general relativity. Our theoretical considerations are illustrated through three-dimensional relativistic many-body simulations.},

The interplay between a periodic input signal, a constant bias and intrinsic thermal noise leads to a resonant ESR phenomenon in which feeble signals become amplified. This new phenomenon is characterized by the presence of two peaks in the spectral amplification at corresponding optimal values of the noise strength. The main peak is associated with the manifest stochastic resonance synchronization mechanism involving the inter-well noise-activated dynamics while a second peak relates to a regime of optimal sensitivity for intra-well dynamics. The nature of ESR, occurring when the origin of the barrier is entropic rather than energetic, offers new perspectives for novel investigations and potential applications. ESR by itself presents yet another case where one constructively can harvest noise in driven nonequilibrium systems.},

In contrast to a recently studied related proteinlike hydrophobic-polar heteropolymer model, aggregation and crystallization are separate processes for a homopolymer with the same small bending rigidity. Rather stiff semiflexible polymers form a liquid-crystal-like phase, as expected. In analogy to the heteropolymer study, we find that the first-order-like aggregation transition of the complexes is accompanied by strong system-size-dependent hierarchical surface effects.

Quenches have been carried out using a linear velocity rescaling according to T ( t ) = T 0 − $\gamma$t where $\gamma$ is the cooling rate. In the present paper we discuss the influence of the initial liquid configuration on the structure of the GeS 2 glass. Structural properties of both liquid and glassy samples are compared. Furthermore a special attention is given to the total neutron structure factor. The decrease of the cooling rate appears in particular to improve the description of the medium range order of the glassy structure. The evolution of both intensity and position of the first sharp diffraction peak with the cooling rate also reveals that the influence of the initial configuration is very limited. Therefore our results confirm that in ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations as in experiment, the quench is the crucial step for structural changes between the liquid and the glassy phase.},

abstract = {In the structural characterization of amorphous materials, the knowledge of the correlation distances and coordination numbers has a key importance. When several correlation distances overlap in the same diffractogram, obtaining the coordination numbers is a quite difficult task. In this work the method to obtain coordination numbers from total structure factor measurements is described in detail. The procedure is focussed in neutron diffraction experiments, but it is also applicable for X-ray diffraction. In order to illustrate the method, it was chosen as example a chalcogenide glass  (Ag 25 Ge 18.75 Se 56.25 ) , a member of a series of ionic conductors that have been studied by neutron diffraction. In particular, the coordination numbers corresponding to the first diffraction peak, involving Ge–Se and Se–Se correlations, are discussed.},

abstract = {Recent molecular-dynamics simulations show that a dilute relativistic gas equilibrates to a Juttner velocity distribution if ensemble velocities are measured simultaneously in the observer frame. The analysis of relativistic Brownian motion processes, on the other hand, implies that stationary one-particle distributions can differ depending on the underlying time parameterizations. Using molecular-dynamics simulations, we demonstrate how this relativistic phenomenon can be understood within a deterministic model system. We show that, depending on the time parameterization, one can distinguish different types of "soft" ergodicity on the level of the one-particle distributions. Our analysis further reveals a close connection between time parameters and entropy in special relativity. A combination of different time parameterizations can potentially be useful in simulations that combine molecular-dynamics algorithms with randomized particle creation, annihilation, or decay processes.},

Theoretical calculations show that such surface waves can lead to breakdown of the Planck’s blackbody radiation law in the near field. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that surface phonon polaritons dramatically enhance energy transfer between two surfaces at small gaps by measuring radiation heat transfer between a microsphere and a flat surface down to 30 nm separation. The corresponding heat transfer coefficients at nanoscale gaps are 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of the blackbody radiation limit. The high energy flux can be exploited to develop new radiative cooling and thermophotovoltaic technologies.},

The results indicate that the storage modulus changes steadily, and the loss modulus peak and the tan$\delta$ peak are broader for strong glass-forming polymers. Three variables, the steepness index ( S ), the transition wideness ( W ) of storage modulus and the integration area ( A ) of tan$\delta$, were defined to illustrate the potential correlation between the dynamic fragility index ( m ) and the dynamic mechanical properties. It is found that  W  and  A  can be correlated with  m  by power law equations, while an exponential relationship between  S  and  m  is observed. Moreover, as  m  decreases, the tan$\delta$ peak is more and more apart from the loss modulus peak and the point where the storage modulus begins to drop.

It predicts that the self-diffusion constant D is proportional to (/T)-1, where  is the structural relaxation time and T is the temperature. Here, we present experimental data on water confirming that, below a crossover temperature T 290 K, the Stokes–Einstein relation is replaced by a 'fractional' Stokes–Einstein relation D(/T)- with 3/5 (refs 1, 2, 34, 5, 6). We interpret the microscopic origin of this crossover by analysing the OH-stretch region of the Fourier transform infrared spectrum over a temperature range from 350 down to 200 K. Simultaneous with the onset of fractional Stokes–Einstein behaviour, we find that water begins to develop a local structure similar to that of low-density amorphous solid H2O. These data lead to an interpretation that the fractional Stokes–Einstein relation in water arises from a specific change in the local water structure. Computer simulations of two molecular models further support this interpretation.},

At the jamming transition for ellipsoids, as distinct from the idealized case using spheres where e=1, there are many unconstrained and nontrivial rotational degrees of freedom. These constitute a set of zero-frequency modes that are gradually mobilized into a new rotational band as |e-1| increases. Quite surprisingly, as this new band is separated from zero frequency by a gap, and lies below the onset frequency for translational vibrations, o*, the presence of these new degrees of freedom leaves unaltered the basic scenario that the translational spectrum is determined only by the average contact number. Indeed, o* depends solely on coordination as it does for compressed packings of spheres. We also discuss the regime of large |e-1|, where the two bands merge.},

The approach, based on a kinetic lattice gas model extracts the diffusion coefficient directly from the master equations which account for the microscopic kinetics of the system in which microscopic processes underlying the diffusion are particle jumps between neighboring adsorption sites. Variational parameters minimizing the evaluated diffusional eigenvalue of the microscopic rate matrix are ‘geometrical’ and ‘correlational’ phases accounting, for the local potential energy landscape experienced by the adsorbed particle and the local correlations, respectively, i.e. an instantaneous occupation pattern of adsorption sites around the particle. Selected results, collective diffusion as a function of particle coverage, for the system of interacting particles adsorbed on a one dimensional non-homogeneous substrate with steps and for a system of non-interacting particles adsorbed on a two dimensional striped–stepped surface are presented and discussed. It is demonstrated in the latter case that the mean field approach which is known in the literature overestimates the diffusion coefficient and corresponds to the variational result in the limit of infinitely fast hopping kinetics in the direction parallel to steps.},

Combined experimental and computational chemistry approaches take advantage of transition-state analogs to reveal dynamic motions linked to transition-state formation. QM/MM transition path sampling from reactive complexes provides both temporal and dynamic information for barrier crossing. Fast (femtosecond to picosecond) dynamic motions provide essential links to enzymatic barrier crossing by local or promoting-mode dynamic searches through bond-vibrational space. Transition-state lifetimes are within the femtosecond timescales of bond vibrations and show no manifestations of stabilized, equilibrated complexes. The slow binding and protein conformational changes (microsecond to millisecond) also required for catalysis are temporally decoupled from the fast dynamic motions forming the transition state. According to this view of enzymatic catalysis, transition states are formed by fast, coincident dynamic excursions of catalytic site elements, while the binding of transition-state analogs is the conversion of the dynamic excursions to equilibrated states.},

A spectroscopic method looks set to change all that. In the half-century since our first glimpse of a protein structure at atomic resolution, structural biology has had a fundamental role in advancing our understanding of biological function at a molecular level. Yet although it is generally agreed that proteins must have some flexibility in order to perform their roles, uncertainty remains about how well static structural models capture the essential features underlying function.},

Several critical states are identified including the onset of local jamming, onset of global jamming and maximally random jammed (MRJ) states. With the increase of packing fraction r, the packing structure transforms from one-dimensional chains to two-dimensional triangles and finally three-dimensional tetrahedra, correspondingly undergoing phase changes from non-jamming to local jamming, global jamming, MRJ and finally crystal structure. There is a competition between FCC (face-centred cubic) and HCP (hexagonal closed packed) in the transition from disordered to ordered structure with the increase of r. HCP can transform to FCC after reaching its maximum at r=0.7.},

We present molecular dynamics simulations of a modified Kob–Andersen binary Lennard-Jones mixture that also crystallizes in lengthy simulations here, however, by forming pure fcc crystals of the majority component. The two findings motivate this paper that gives a general thermodynamic and kinetic treatment of the stability of supercooled binary mixtures, emphasizing the importance of negative mixing enthalpy whenever present. The theory is used to estimate the crystallization time in a Kob–Andersen mixture from the crystallization time in a series of related systems. At T = 0.40 we estimate this time to be 5×107 time units ( ≈ 0.1 ms). A new binary Lennard-Jones mixture is proposed that is not prone to crystallization and faster to simulate than the two standard binary Lennard-Jones mixtures. This is obtained by removing the like-particle attractions by switching to Weeks–Chandler–Andersen type potentials, while maintaining the unlike-particle attraction.},

These scaled, universal subvelocity fluctuations emerge due to the weak ergodicity breaking and are vanishing in the limit of normal diffusion.

However, because thermal motion becomes relevant when the particles are small enough, it is imperative to understand how these length scales evolve as the temperature is increased. Here we used both colloidal experiments and computer simulations to progress beyond the zero-temperature limit to track one of the key parameters—the overlap distance between neighbouring particles—which vanishes at the T = 0 jamming transition. We find that this structural feature retains a vestige of its T = 0 behaviour and evolves in an unusual manner, which has masked its appearance until now. It is evident as a function of packing fraction at fixed temperature, but not as a function of temperature at fixed packing fraction or pressure. Our results conclusively demonstrate that length scales associated with the T = 0 jamming transition persist in thermal systems, not only in simulations but also in laboratory experiments.},

Until now there has been no clear understanding of why this is, nor any general criterion as to which form to expect in a given practical situation. Here, a general scaling argument is presented, specific to spatially averaged properties, that indicates the following simple rule: if the mean value increases rapidly with system size then a power-law distribution is appropriate; if it changes slowly then a 'generalized Gumbel distribution' is likely, and if it decreases rapidly then an exponentially truncated power-law distribution is appropriate. The three scenarios are connected with the well-established classification of a scaling variable as either irrelevant, marginal or relevant. This result is supported by the current data set and finally renders comprehensible the fact that real critical properties exhibit diverse and apparently unrelated distributions, instead of ubiquitous heavy tails.},

As SC is not directly accessible by experiments, it was estimated, following a common procedure in literature, from the excess entropy Sexc of the supercooled liquid with respect to the crystal, determined from calorimetric and expansivity measurements over the same T-P range of dynamics investigation. The AG relation, predicting linear dependence between the logarithmic of structural relaxation time and the reciprocal of the product of temperature with configurational entropy, was successfully tested. Actually, a bilinear relation between Sexc and SC was found, with different proportionality factors in isothermal and isobaric conditions. Using such results, we derived an equation for predicting the pressure dependence of the glass transition temperature, in good accordance with the experimental values in literature.},

abstract = {This paper describes how the fragility of a liquid is linked to the ratio between the energy barrier (Eeq) for the equilibrium viscous behavior and that (Eiso) for the non-equilibrium iso-structural viscous behavior. Using the concept of iso-structural viscosity, two functions describing the variation of the configurational entropy (Sc) with temperature (T) are obtained from the Avramov-Milchev (AM) and the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) viscosity equations, respectively. The two Sc(T) functions exhibit different relations to the liquid fragility. The AM Sc(T) function is a power function with the exponent of F - 1, where F is the AM fragility index. In this case, Sc vanishes at T = 0 K. For the VFT function, Sc vanishes as T is lowered to a finite temperature T0, whereas it reaches the maximum value Sc,max at infinitively high T. Sc,max is proportional to the VFT fragility index. Thus, the VFT equation is not only a dynamical, but also a thermodynamic model. It is proved that for oxide liquids, the VFT equation describes viscosity data better than the AM equation, provided the pre-exponential factor [eta]0 is fixed to a generally accepted value, e.g., 10-3.5 Pa s.},

abstract = {Since the pioneering work of Bridgman it has been known that pressure affects the glass transition of polymers and liquid state viscosities. Usually the Tg and viscosity both increase as a function of pressure as expected from [`]free volume' theories. However, H2O provided a notable exception in that the viscosity passes through a minimum at low temperature. It was thought that this might be linked to the anomalous thermal expansion behavior. However further research on geologically important aluminosilicate liquids revealed that they could show anomalous viscosity decreases with increasing pressure and this behavior is given a structural interpretation as five-fold coordinated Si4+ and Al3+ species are formed. Also the existence of polyamorphism or density-driven liquid-liquid phase transitions in certain systems can lead to anomalies in the Tg or [eta] vs. P relations. This may be the case for H2O, for example. Current research is focusing on investigating structural changes in liquids and glasses at high pressure as the rich variety of behavior is becoming recognized. Both experimental studies and computer simulations are important as the underlying phenomonology is linked to changes in the glass or liquid structure as a function of densification.},

abstract = {Conventional theories of glass transition are focussed on reproducing the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the structural [alpha]-process. However, in the last decade a class of secondary relaxations, called the Johari-Goldstein (JG) [beta]-relaxations, has attracted attention in view of the existence of various correlations and similarities of its properties with the structural [alpha]-process. These experimental evidences suggest that the secondary process may play a fundamental role in glass transition, and any theory of glass transition would be incomplete until the inter-relations between the JG [beta]-relaxation and the structural relaxation have been considered. In this paper, some significant experimental results showing several general and nontrivial connections between structural relaxation and JG [beta]-relaxation are reported. In particular, these connections indicate that, like the structural relaxation, the JG [beta]-relaxation is entropy and volume dependent. The experimental facts are consistent with the results of the coupling model.},

In the case of hard potential systems such as hard discs, spheres and ellipsoids, an inherent structure corresponds to a collectively jammed configuration. This work develops a tiling based approach to counting inherent structures that constructs packings by combining sets of elementary locally jammed structures but eliminates those final packings that either, do not tile space, or are not collectively jammed, through the use of tile incompatibility rules. The resulting theory contains a number of geometric quantities, such as the number of growth sites on a tile and the number of tile compatibilities that provide insight into the number of inherent structures in certain limits. We also show that these geometric quantities become quite simple in a system of highly confined hard discs.},

Thermodynamic quantities are given by their average over basins of the landscape, and a transition from the annealed average at high temperatures to the quenched average at low temperatures manifests itself as the glass transition where the specific heat shows a jump. We discuss the relation between the configurational entropy and the specific heat, where we argue the existence of an additional contribution due to the temperature dependence of the FEL in the specific heat.

abstract = {Traditional glass formation involves the cooling of a liquid at a rate fast enough to avoid crystallization. The glass transition process and the resulting glassy state can be modeled using the enthalpy landscape approach, which involves mapping the configurational space to a discrete set of basins and the connecting transition points. At equilibrium, the probability of occupying any basin is given by the Boltzmann distribution. Na\"{\i}vely, one might expect that a nonequilibrium glassy system could form in any region of this probability space. In this paper, we show that only a small subset of the probability space is accessible to glasses formed by cooling from a melt. As a consequence, the physical properties of a glass are restricted to those corresponding to this limited region of phase space. For any realistic glass-forming system, the majority of phase space is forbidden, inaccessible from any thermal treatment path. In addition, we show that the fictive temperature description of the glassy state is valid only in the case of a simple two-basin landscape and cannot be applied to more complicated systems. In other words, the nonequilibrium state of a glass cannot be described in terms of any linear combination of equilibrium states.},

The purpose of the work and discussion was motivated by a view that some of the frameworks in which we currently look at glassy behavior, while potentially useful, may also have limitations that we often do not fully consider. Discussion focuses on isochoric glass formation paths, thermodynamic and dynamic fragilities and how dynamic fragility in many systems (especially polymers, metals, ionic liquids and hydrogen bonding systems) seems to vary primarily with the glass transition temperature itself. This leads to the conclusion that such systems have an apparent activation energy that varies as the square of the glass temperature. The work then discusses evidence for a non-diverging relaxation time or viscosity as the glass temperature is approached and ends with a discussion of the Prigogine-Defay ratio.},

Particular attention is devoted here to the estimation of the value of the Prigogine-Defay ratio [Pi] and the analysis of the behavior of the entropy in vitrification. In contrast to previous findings it is shown that treating vitrification correctly as proceeding in some interval of temperature and/or pressure the use of only one structural order parameter is sufficient to explain the generally obtained experimentally results [Pi] > 1. In addition, an analysis of some alternative approaches of introduction of different order parameters is performed and relationships between different structural order parameters are analyzed. It is shown how the concept of an internal (fictive) pressure can be introduced straightforwardly in terms of the generic approach described. Finally, within the framework of the generic approach utilized here, a general model-independent definition of internal (fictive) pressure and fictive temperature is given for the case that an arbitrary number of structural order parameters is required for the description and some further consequences are discussed briefly.},

abstract = {Essentially from differential scanning calorimetry and viscosimetry, the residual configurational entropy below the glass transition is determined for two linearly cooled commercial optical glasses, K7(TM) and N-LaK12(TM) from SCHOTT. The procedure is according to the conventional understanding of glass entropy and the conventional description of the configurational state by a distribution of fictive temperatures. For a cooling rate of 10 K/min, the residual entropy values found below the glass transition are 0.146 J/(g K) for K7(TM) and 0.148 J/(g K) for N-LaK12(TM). The result is discussed comparing with both the lower limit for the residual entropy resulting from the reversibly exchanged heat ([integral operator]dq/T, [`]Clausius limit') and the upper limit given by the configurational entropy of an equilibrium liquid with the same fictive temperature. The difference between the residual entropy and its lower limit is equal to the entropy generation due to the fall-out from equilibrium during linear cooling. The difference between the residual entropy and its upper limit is the driving force of the crossover- (or Kovacs-) effect. It turns out that the difference between the residual entropy and the Clausius limit is very small. The values found amount to less than 0.0001 J/(g K) for both glasses. Therefore, this difference can be neglected concerning the extrapolation of the Adam-Gibbs relation to low temperatures.},

This theory is also in harmony with the mechanisms of viscous flow, as understood from NMR experiments, according to which viscosity is controlled by the rate of bond rearrangements between network-forming cations and oxygens. As a matter of fact, Adam and Gibbs basic expression relating structural relaxation times to the reciprocal of the product of temperature and configurational entropy can be derived from a phenomenological analysis of the temperature dependence of the activation energy for viscous flow. Adam-Gibbs theory thus works well for silicate melts because network-modifying cations also play a role in bond rearrangements such that, as a bulk property, configurational entropy is actually relevant to structural relaxation and flow.},

abstract = {A thermodynamic framework for the investigation of [`]residual entropy' and related phenomena is developed, expanding and clarifying the work of Kivelson and Reiss and the important work of several other investigators. The main difficulties encountered in the development of such a framework are the need to deal with constrained equilibrium as well as to include irreversible processes in the overall study. These challenges are met by using the device of auxiliary constraints and the equivalent equilibrated states that they produce. The importance of a thermodynamic framework is tied to the fact that evolving molecular theories of residual entropy, which also impact the glass transition, no matter how sophisticated, invariably contain approximations whose effects are hard to assess. Thus a thermodynamic framework provides a vehicle within which the internal consistency of a theory can be tested. Phenomena that are treated in such a framework, along with others, are those mentioned in the title of this paper. The concept of residual entropy, its reality or unreality, is often considered to be an unimportant issue. The findings of this paper, besides emphasizing the unreality of residual entropy, show that the question of its existence is a significant one. Among other things, the fundamental principle of causality is involved and we should not be so cavalier as to dispense with it. Among other rigorous analysis we present an argument involving an ideal binary solution whose behavior as the limiting behavior of a real solution provides access, in principle, to experiment. The argument does make the generally accepted assumption that, at equilibrium at 0 K, pure crystals of the binary system's components have zero entropy. It strongly suggests that residual entropy, in general, is an impression that stems from the inclusion of an irreversible step in an experimental thermodynamic cycle.},

The problem of functional dissimilarity of the heat capacity of glass and that of crystal has been solved within the framework of the principle of free energy minimization as a result of self-organization of the vibration spectrum according to the frozen structure. The complete stabilization of glass structure at Kauzmann's temperature or below it is forbidden by topologic reasons and (or) by thermodynamics.

According to the conventional view, the configurational entropy of a liquid is ‘frozen’ below the glass transition temperature ( T g ) all the way to absolute zero. Contrary to this, we claim that: (i) there is an entropy loss associated with the liquid to glass transition, and (ii) the configurational entropy in the glassy state vanishes at absolute zero. This paper contrasts our arguments (called the ‘entropy loss’ view) and the conventional view.},

@article{Gutzow2009,
abstract = {A survey is given on the historical development of ideas, concerning the Third Principle of thermodynamics and the thermodynamic nature of glasses. The classical thermodynamic approach of Nernst, Einstein and Planck is given in its development together with the way thermodynamics of irreversible processes is treating the kinetics of glass-transition. It is shown that both these classical ideas and the generic application of non-equilibrium thermodynamics determine the non-zero value of the zero-point entropy of glasses and the value of the other frozen-in thermodynamic functions of glass, their dependence on cooling rate and on glass structure. For many years glass science was governed by ideas, formulated 80 years ago by F. Simon: glasses as non-equilibrium, non-thermodynamic systems do not obey the classical requirements of the Third Principle. It is shown here that in fact glasses and most probably any other frozen-in systems, every non-equilibrium body, follow the Third Principle, although in a particular way. In glasses a considerable amount of configurational entropy is frozen-in and this statement is confirmed by experiment. The frozen-in value of the configurational entropy, determining substantially the properties of a glass, does not prevent vitrified systems to follow the requirements of a sufficiently generally formulated version of the Third Principle (different from the formulation commonly assigned to Planck), in the same way as matter in non-equilibrium states follows the requirements (again in a specific way) of both the Second and the First Principles of thermodynamics. It is shown, that calorimetric determinations, vapor pressure measurements, dissolution kinetics, the analysis of volume properties and the viscosity course upon vitrification directly demonstrate the existence of a frozen-in configurational entropy of glasses and its dependence on the vitrification kinetics.},

abstract = {We propose a generalized definition of entropy accounting for the continuous breakdown of ergodicity at the laboratory glass transition. Our approach is applicable through all regimes of glass forming, from the equilibrium liquid state through the glass transition range and into the glassy state at low temperatures. The continuous loss of ergodicity during the laboratory glass transition is accompanied by a loss of entropy as the system gradually becomes trapped in a subset of the configurational phase space. Using a hierarchical master equation approach, we compute the configurational entropy of selenium, a simple but realistic glass-former, for cooling rates covering 25 orders of magnitude, viz., 10 −12  to 10 12  K/s. In all cases, the entropy of glass is zero in the limit of absolute zero temperature, since here the system is necessarily confined to a single microstate.},

@article{Liu2002,
abstract = {The structural relaxation time is a measure of the molecular mobility involved in enthalpy relaxation, and thus, is a measure of the dynamics of amorphous (glassy) pharmaceutical solids that determines physicochemical properties and reactivity of drugs in amorphous formulations. In this article we describe a novel method for characterization of structural relaxation using isothermal microcalorimetry, which directly measures the rate of heat release during the relaxation processes. The structural relaxation time is then obtained from a fit of the power data to the derivative version of the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) equation. The relaxation times of quenched and lyophilized samples of saccharides were studied using an isothermal microcalorimeter, the Thermal Activity Monitor (TAM). In addition to the KWW derivative function, a derivative equation of the modified stretched exponential function (MSE) was employed to evaluate TAM data. The later (MSE) appeared to have numerical advantages over the KWW equation. The data demonstrate, as expected, that structural relaxation times of amorphous solids depend on a number of variables, including nature of material, temperature, moisture content, thermal history, etc. Isothermal microcalorimetry with the TAM provides a very fast and reliable way to characterize the dynamics of glassy materials, which in many respects is superior to the conventional DSC approach. To the extent stability and structural relaxation dynamics in the glass are correlated, structural relaxation parameters derived by isothermal microcalorimetry may provide data useful for rational development of stable peptide and protein formulations and for the control of their processing. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical Association J Pharm Sci 91:1853-1862, 2002},

We studied the effects of salt on the aggregation of such dipolar particles in aqueous suspensions. Upon addition of salt, dipolar colloid particles were found to give linear aggregates. We then extended this microcontact printing technique to the directed assembly of colloidal particles. Microcontact printing of one colloidal monolayer over a latex particle monolayer of opposite charge was used to fabricate particles of complex internal structure. We demonstrated that if the two colloid monolayers consist of particles of comparable sizes, this method allows fabrication of particle doublets. When the particle monolayer was stamped with another colloid monolayer of much smaller particle size complex structures as half-coated raspberry-like particles were obtained. Possible applications of these asymmetrically coated colloids include photonic crystals with novel symmetries, colloidal substitutes for liquid crystals and water-based electrorheological fluids.},

abstract = {Kinetically constrained models (KCMs) have been used to study and understand the origin of glassy dynamics. Despite having trivial thermodynamic properties, their dynamics slows down dramatically at low temperatures while displaying dynamical heterogeneity as seen in glass forming supercooled liquids. This dynamics has its origin in an ergodic-nonergodic first-order phase transition between phases of distinct dynamical "activity". This is a "space-time" transition as it corresponds to a singular change in ensembles of trajectories of the dynamics rather than ensembles of configurations. Here we extend these ideas to driven glassy systems by considering KCMs driven into non-equilibrium steady states through non-conservative forces. By classifying trajectories through their entropy production we prove that driven KCMs also display an analogous first-order space-time transition between dynamical phases of finite and vanishing entropy production. We also discuss how trajectories with rare values of entropy production can be realized as typical trajectories of a mapped system with modified forces.},

The ultrastructure of the brain can now be excellently preserved by vitrification, and solutions needed for vitrification can now be distributed through organs with retention of organ viability after transplantation.

abstract = {Packing problems are ubiquitous1, 2, ranging from oil extraction through porous rocks to grain storage in silos and the compaction of pharmaceutical powders into tablets. At a given density, particulate systems pack into a mechanically stable and amorphous jammed state3, 4. Previous theoretical studies have explored a connection between this jammed state and the glass transition4, 5, 6, 7, 8, the thermodynamics of jamming9, 10, 11, 12 and geometric modelling of random packings13, 14, 15. Nevertheless, a simple underlying mechanism for the random assembly of athermal particles, analogous to crystalline ordering, remains unknown. Here we use three-dimensional measurements of packings of polydisperse emulsion droplets to build a simple statistical model in which the complexity of the global packing is distilled into a local stochastic process. From the perspective of a single particle, the packing problem is reduced to the random formation of nearest neighbours, followed by a choice of contacts among them. The two key parameters in the model—the available space around a particle and the ratio of contacts to neighbours—are directly obtained from experiments. We demonstrate that this 'granocentric' view captures the properties of the polydisperse emulsion packing—ranging from the microscopic distributions of nearest neighbours and contacts, to local density fluctuations, to the global packing density. Application of our results to monodisperse and bidisperse systems produces quantitative agreement with previously measured trends in global density16. Our model therefore reveals a general principle of organization for random packing and may provide the foundations for a theory of jammed matter.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of supercooling in metals-that is, the preservation of a disordered, fluid phase in a metastable state well below the melting point-has led to speculation that local atomic structure configurations of dense, symmetric, but non-periodic packing act as the main barrier for crystal nucleation. For liquids in contact with solids, crystalline surfaces induce layering of the adjacent atoms in the liquid and may prevent or lower supercooling. This seed effect is supposed to depend on the local lateral order adopted in the last atomic layers of the liquid in contact with the crystal. Although it has been suggested that there might be a direct coupling between surface-induced lateral order and supercooling, no experimental observation of such lateral ordering at interfaces is available. Here we report supercooling in gold-silicon (AuSi) eutectic droplets, enhanced by a Au-induced (6 x 6) reconstruction of the Si(111) substrate. In situ X-ray scattering and ab initio molecular dynamics reveal that pentagonal atomic arrangements of Au atoms at this interface favour a lateral-ordering stabilization process of the liquid phase. This interface-enhanced stabilization of the liquid state shows the importance of the solid-liquid interaction for the structure of the adjacent liquid layers. Such processes are important for present and future technologies, as fluidity and crystallization play a key part in soldering and casting, as well as in processing and controlling chemical reactions for microfluidic devices or during the vapour-liquid-solid growth of semiconductor nanowires.},

Using this framework, we derive a general minimal-variance estimator that can combine nonequilibrium trajectory data sampled from multiple path-ensembles to estimate arbitrary functions of nonequilibrium expectations. The framework is also applied to obtain asymptotic variance estimates, which are a useful measure of statistical uncertainty. In particular, we develop asymptotic variance estimates pertaining to Jarzynski's equality for free energies and the Hummer-Szabo expressions for the potential of mean force, calculated from uni- or bidirectional path samples. These estimators are demonstrated on a model single-molecule pulling experiment. In these simulations, the asymptotic variance expression is found to accurately characterize the confidence intervals around estimators when the bias is small. Hence, the confidence intervals are inaccurately described for unidirectional estimates with large bias, but for this model it largely reflects the true error in a bidirectional estimator derived by Minh and Adib.},

The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

@article{Zhou2009,
abstract = {Mechanical robustness of the cell under different modes of stress and deformation is essential to its survival and function. Under tension, mechanical rigidity is provided by the cytoskeletal network; with increasing stress, this network stiffens, providing increased resistance to deformation. However, a cell must also resist compression, which will inevitably occur whenever cell volume is decreased during such biologically important processes as anhydrobiosis and apoptosis. Under compression, individual filaments can buckle, thereby reducing the stiffness and weakening the cytoskeletal network. However, the intracellular space is crowded with macromolecules and organelles that can resist compression. A simple picture describing their behavior is that of colloidal particles; colloids exhibit a sharp increase in viscosity with increasing volume fraction, ultimately undergoing a glass transition and becoming a solid. We investigate the consequences of these 2 competing effects and show that as a cell is compressed by hyperosmotic stress it becomes progressively more rigid. Although this stiffening behavior depends somewhat on cell type, starting conditions, molecular motors, and cytoskeletal contributions, its dependence on solid volume fraction is exponential in every instance. This universal behavior suggests that compression-induced weakening of the network is overwhelmed by crowding-induced stiffening of the cytoplasm. We also show that compression dramatically slows intracellular relaxation processes. The increase in stiffness, combined with the slowing of relaxation processes, is reminiscent of a glass transition of colloidal suspensions, but only when comprised of deformable particles. Our work provides a means to probe the physical nature of the cytoplasm under compression, and leads to results that are universal across cell type.},

abstract = {Models of protein energetics that neglect interactions between amino acids that are not adjacent in the native state, such as the Gō model, encode or underlie many influential ideas on protein folding. Implicit in this simplification is a crucial assumption that has never been critically evaluated in a broad context: Detailed mechanisms of protein folding are not biased by nonnative contacts, typically argued to be a consequence of sequence design and/or topology. Here we present, using computer simulations of a well-studied lattice heteropolymer model, the first systematic test of this oft-assumed correspondence over the statistically significant range of hundreds of thousands of amino acid sequences that fold to the same native structure. Contrary to previous conjectures, we find a multiplicity of folding mechanisms, suggesting that Gō-like models cannot be justified by considerations of topology alone. Instead, we find that the crucial factor in discriminating among topological pathways is the heterogeneity of native contact energies: The order in which native contacts accumulate is profoundly insensitive to omission of nonnative interactions, provided that native contact heterogeneity is retained. This robustness holds over a surprisingly wide range of folding rates for our designed sequences. Mirroring predictions based on the principle of minimum frustration, fast-folding sequences match their Gō-like counterparts in both topological mechanism and transit times. Less optimized sequences dwell much longer in the unfolded state and/or off-pathway intermediates than do Gō-like models. For dynamics that bridge unfolded and unfolded states, however, even slow folders exhibit topological mechanisms and transit times nearly identical with those of their Gō-like counterparts. Our results do not imply a direct correspondence between folding trajectories of Gō-like models and those of real proteins, but they do help to clarify key topological and energetic assumptions that are commonly used to justify such caricatures.},

abstract = {Glasses can be formed by many routes. In some cases, distinct polyamorphic forms are found. The normal mode of glass formation is cooling of a viscous liquid. Liquid behavior during cooling is classified between "strong" and "fragile," and the three canonical characteristics of relaxing liquids are correlated through the fragility. Strong liquids become fragile liquids on compression. In some cases, such conversions occur during cooling by a weak first-order transition. This behavior can be related to the polymorphism in a glass state through a recent simple modification of the van der Waals model for tetrahedrally bonded liquids. The sudden loss of some liquid degrees of freedom through such first-order transitions is suggestive of the polyamorphic transition between native and denatured hydrated proteins, which can be interpreted as single-chain glass-forming polymers plasticized by water and cross-linked by hydrogen bonds. The onset of a sharp change in ddT( is the Debye-Waller factor and T is temperature) in proteins, which is controversially indentified with the glass transition in liquids, is shown to be general for glass formers and observable in computer simulations of strong and fragile ionic liquids, where it proves to be close to the experimental glass transition temperature. The latter may originate in strong anharmonicity in modes ("bosons"), which permits the system to access multiple minima of its configuration space. These modes, the Kauzmann temperature TK, and the fragility of the liquid, may thus be connected.},

Therefore, thermodynamic length is of central interest in understanding matter out of equilibrium. In this Letter, we will consider how to define thermodynamic length for a small system described by equilibrium statistical mechanics and how to measure thermodynamic length within a computer simulation. Surprisingly, Bennett's classic acceptance ratio method for measuring free energy differences also measures thermodynamic length.},

@article{Whitelam2010,
abstract = {This chapter describes the use of Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the
overdamped (low Reynolds number) dynamics of classical particles in implicit
solvent, with a focus on self-assembling nanoscale components equipped with
strong, short-ranged and anisotropic interactions. Conventional Monte Carlo
simulations comprise sequential moves of single particles, proposed and
accepted so as to satisfy detailed balance. We will review simple arguments and
recent results showing that under certain circumstances such simulations
provide a good approximation of overdamped dynamics. However, this
correspondence breaks down when e.g. particle-particle interactions vary
strongly with distance or angle. In such cases, single-particle moves can
underrepresent important collective modes of relaxation, such as self-diffusion
of particle clusters. The twin requirements of simulation efficiency (trial
moves of appreciable scale are needed to ensure reasonable sampling) and
dynamical fidelity (true in the limit of vanishing trial move scale) then
become irreconcilable. However, one way within Monte Carlo simulation to
approximate `real' collective modes of motion and retain the ability to make
trial moves of reasonable scale is to make explicit moves of collections of
particles. We will outline ways of doing so by iteratively linking particles to
their environment. Linking criteria can be static, conditioned upon properties
of the current state of a system, or dynamic, conditioned upon energy changes
resulting from trial virtual moves of particles. We discuss the advantages and
drawbacks of each scheme.},

define the local dynamics, we consider two time intervals: the alpha-relaxation
time and the time at which the non-Gaussian parameter of the Van Hove
self-correlation function is maximized. We investigated the static structure of
the heterogeneous dynamics in these two time intervals by calculating the
spatial correlation function of the particle dynamics. We quantified the
correlation length and the intensity and found that both the correlation length
and the intensity are different in the two time intervals. The temperature
dependences of two correlation lenghts are notably different. We also
determined the lifetimes of the heterogeneous dynamics in the two time
intervals by calculating the time correlation function of the particle
dynamics. We find that the difference between two lifetimes increases with
decreasing temperature. Thus, we conclude that the properties of dynamical
heterogeneity, including the correlation length, the intensity, and the
lifetime, depend strongly on the time interval.},

characterized by the rattling of monomers or particles in the cage formed by
their neighbors. Recently, a direct correlation in such systems, described by a
universal scaling form, has been established between the rattling amplitude and
the structural relaxation time. In this paper we analyze the glassy dynamics
emerging from the formation of a persistent network in a model colloidal gel at
very low density. The structural relaxation time of the gel network is compared
with the mean squared displacement at short times, corresponding to the
localization length associated to the presence of energetic bonds.
Interestingly, we find that the same type of scaling as for the dense glassy
systems holds. Our findings well elucidate the strong coupling between the
cooperative rearrangements of the gel network and the single particle
localization in the structure. Our results further indicate that the scaling
captures indeed fundamental physical elements of glassy dynamics.},

@article{Kuriabova2010,
abstract = {Many soft-matter and biophysical systems are composed of monomers which
reversibly assemble into rod-like aggregates. The aggregates can then order
into liquid-crystal phases if the density is high enough, and liquid-crystal
ordering promotes increased growth of aggregates. Systems that display coupled
aggregation and liquid-crystal ordering include wormlike micelles, chromonic
liquid crystals, DNA and RNA, and protein polymers and fibrils. Coarse-grained
molecular models that capture key features of coupled aggregation and
liquid-crystal ordering common to many different systems are lacking; in
particular, the role of monomer aspect ratio and aggregate flexibility in
controlling the phase behavior are not well understood. Here we study a minimal
system of sticky cylinders using Monte Carlo simulations and analytic theory.
Cylindrical monomers interact primarily by hard-core interactions but can stack
and bind end to end. We present results for several different cylinder aspect
ratios and a range of end-to-end binding energies. The phase diagrams are
qualitatively similar to those of chromonic liquid crystals, with an
isotropic-nematic-columnar triple point. The location of the triple point is
sensitive to the monomer aspect ratio.We find that the aggregate persistence
length varies with temperature in a way that is controlled by the interaction
potential; this suggests that the form of the interaction potential affects the
phase behavior of the system. Our analytic theory shows improvement compared to
previous theory in quantitatively predicting the I-N transition for relatively
stiff aggregates, but requires a better treatment of aggregate flexibility.},

abstract = {In a recent quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiment on water confined in a Portland cement paste, we find that this 3D confined water shows a dynamic crossover phenomenon at T L = 227 ± 5 K. The DSC heat-flow scan upon cooling and an independent measurement of specific heat at constant pressure of confined water in silica gel show a prominent peak at the same temperature. We show in this paper that this type of behavior is common to many other glassy liquids, which also show the crossover temperature in coincidence with the temperature of a small specific heat peak. We also demonstrate with MD simulations that the dynamic crossover phenomenon in confined water is an intrinsic property of bulk water, and is not due to the confinement effect. Recently, an extended version of the mode coupling theory (MCT) including the hopping effect was developed. This theory shows that, instead of a structural arrest transition at T C predicted by the idealized MCT, a fragile-to-strong dynamic crossover phenomenon takes place instead at T C , confirming both the experimental and the numerical results. The coherent and incoherent $\alpha$ relaxation times can be scaled with the calculated viscosity, showing the same crossover phenomenon. We thus demonstrated with experiments, simulations and theory that a genuine change of dynamical behavior of both water and many glassy liquids happens at the crossover temperature T L , which is 10–30\% higher than the calorimetric glass transition temperature T g .},

abstract = {It is argued that the extended mode-coupling theory for glass transition predicts a dynamic crossover in the $\alpha$-relaxation time and in the self-diffusion constant as a general implication of the structure of its equations of motion. This crossover occurs near the critical temperature T c of the idealized version of the theory, and is caused by the change in the dynamics from the one determined by the cage effect to that dominated by hopping processes. When combined with a model for the hopping kernel deduced from the dynamical theory for diffusion–jump processes, the dynamic crossover can be identified as the fragile-to-strong crossover (FSC) in which the $\alpha$-relaxation time and the self-diffusion constant cross over from a non-Arrhenius to an Arrhenius behavior. Since the present theory does not resort to the existence of the so-called Widom line, to which the FSC in confined water has been attributed, it provides a possible explanation of the FSC observed in a variety of glass-forming systems in which the existence of the Widom line is unlikely. In addition, the present theory predicts that the Stokes–Einstein relation (SER) breaks down in different ways on the fragile and strong sides of the FSC, in agreement with the experimental observation in confined water. It is also demonstrated that the violation of the SER in both the fragile and strong regions can be fitted reasonably well by a single fractional relation with an empirical exponent of 0.85.},

We review the pros and cons that support or undermine the theory, and the directions, both theoretical and experimental, where progress is needed to ascertain the status of RFOT. We elaborate in particular on the notions of mosaic state and point-to-set correlations, and insist on the importance of fluctuations in finite dimensions, that significantly blur the expected cross-over between a Mode-Coupling like regime and the mosaic, activated regime. We discuss in detail the fundamental predictions of RFOT, in particular the possibility to force a small enough system into an ideal glass state, and present several new ones, concerning aging properties or non-linear rheology. Finally, we compare RFOT to other recent theories, including elastic models, Frustration Limited Domains or Kinetically Constrained models.},

abstract = {We review a theoretical perspective of the dynamics of glass-forming liquids and the glass transition, a perspective developed during this past decade based on the structure of trajectory space. This structure emerges from spatial correlations of dynamics that appear in disordered systems as they approach nonergodic or jammed states. It is characterized in terms of dynamical heterogeneity, facilitation, and excitation lines. These features are associated with a newly discovered class of nonequilibrium phase transitions. Equilibrium properties have little, if anything, to do with it. The broken symmetries of these transitions are obscure or absent in spatial structures, but they are vivid in space-time (i.e., trajectory space). In our view, the glass transition is an example of this class of transitions. The basic ideas and principles we review were originally developed through the analysis of idealized and abstract models. Nevertheless, the central ideas are easily illustrated with reference to molecular dynamics of more realistic atomistic models, and we use that illustrative approach here.},

In this picture, we discuss time-dependent effects of glass transition, and identify three distinct regimes of relaxation.

In this review, the experimental work that characterizes this heterogeneity is described. In particular, the following questions are addressed: How large are the heterogeneities? How long do they last? How much do dynamics vary between the fastest and slowest regions? Why do these heterogeneities arise?

The most common way of making a glass is by cooling a viscous liquid fast enough to avoid crystallization.

Here we discuss current theoretical knowledge of the manner in which intermolecular forces give rise to complex behaviour in supercooled liquids and glasses. An intriguing aspect of this behaviour is the apparent connection between dynamics and thermodynamics. The multidimensional potential energy surface as a function of particle coordinates (the energy landscape) offers a convenient viewpoint for the analysis and interpretation of supercooling and glass-formation phenomena. That much of this analysis is at present largely qualitative reflects the fact that precise computations of how viscous liquids sample their landscape have become possible only recently.},

We show that the low-temperature states of these systems resemble glassy mosaic states, despite the fact that excitations are localized and that there are no static singularities. By means of finite-size thermodynamics we study a generalized caging effect whereby the system is frozen on short length scales, but free at larger length scales. We find that the freezing length scales obtained from statics coincide with those relevant to dynamic correlations, as expected in the mosaic view. The simple nucleation arguments of the mosaic approach, however, do not give the correct relation between freezing lengths and relaxation times, as they do not capture the transition states for relaxation.

abstract = {Abstract: The relationship between spatially heterogeneous dynamics (SHD) and jamming is studied in a glass-forming binary Lennard-Jones system via molecular dynamics simulations. It has been suggested Phys. Rev. Lett. 2001, 86, 1111 that the probability distribution of interparticle forces P(F) develops a peak at the glass transition temperature Tg and that the large force inhomogeneities, responsible for structural arrest in granular materials, are related to dynamical heterogeneities in supercooled liquids that form glasses. It has been further suggested that "force chains" present in granular materials may exist in supercooled liquids and may provide an order parameter for the glass transition. Our goal is to investigate the extent to which the forces experienced by particles in a glass-forming liquid are related to SHD and compare these forces to those observed in granular materials and other glass-forming systems. Our results are summarized as follows. We calculate P(F) for positive (repulsive) instantaneous forces and find no peak in P(F) at any temperature in our system, even below Tg. We also find that particles that have been localized for a long time are less likely to experience high relative force and that mobile particles experience higher relative forces at shorter time scales, indicating a correlation between pairwise forces and particle mobility. We construct force chains based on the magnitude of pairwise positive instantaneous forces. We find that force chains constructed in this manner are composed of both localized and mobile particles; therefore there is no one-to-one correspondence between force chains as defined here and locally mobile or immobile regions of the liquid. We also find that force chains do not play the same role as force chains in granular materials but may indicate a difference in the evolution of the local environment of particles with different mobility. We also discuss a possible relationship between force chains found here and the development of stringlike motion found in this and other glass-forming liquids Phys. Rev. Lett. 1998, 80, 2338; J.

abstract = {In a recent quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiment on water confined in a Portland cement paste, we find that this 3D confined water shows a dynamic crossover phenomenon at T-L = 227 5 K. The DSC heat-flow scan upon cooling and an independent measurement of specific heat at constant pressure of confined water in silica gel show a prominent peak at the same temperature. We show in this paper that this type of behavior is common to many other glassy liquids, which also show the crossover temperature in coincidence with the temperature of a small specific heat peak. We also demonstrate with MD simulations that the dynamic crossover phenomenon in confined water is an intrinsic property of bulk water, and is not due to the confinement effect. Recently, an extended version of the mode coupling theory (MCT) including the hopping effect was developed. This theory shows that, instead of a structural arrest transition at T-C predicted by the idealized MCT, a fragile-to-strong dynamic crossover phenomenon takes place instead at T-C, confirming both the experimental and the numerical results. The coherent and incoherent alpha relaxation times can be scaled with the calculated viscosity, showing the same crossover phenomenon. We thus demonstrated with experiments, simulations and theory that a genuine change of dynamical behavior of both water and many glassy liquids happens at the crossover temperature T-L, which is 10-30\% higher than the calorimetric glass transition temperature T-g.},

abstract = {The jamming scenario of disordered media, formulated about 10 years ago, has in recent years been advanced by analyzing model systems of granular media. This has led to various new concepts that are increasingly being explored in in a variety of systems. This chapter contains an introductory review of these recent developments and provides an outlook on their applicability to different physical systems and on future directions. The first part of the paper is devoted to an overview of the findings for model systems of frictionless spheres, focussing on the excess of low-frequency modes as the jamming point is approached. Particular attention is paid to a discussion of the cross-over frequency and length scales that govern this approach. We then discuss the effects of particle asphericity and static friction, the applicability to bubble models for wet foams in which the friction is dynamic, the dynamical arrest in colloids, and the implications for molecular glasses.},

@article{Schweizer2004a,
abstract = {A statistical mechanical theory of collective dynamic barriers, slow segmental relaxation, and the glass transition of polymer melts is developed by combining, and in some aspects extending, methods of mode coupling, density functional, and activated hopping transport theories. A coarse-grained description of polymer chains is adopted and the melt is treated as a liquid of segments. The theory is built on the idea that collective density fluctuations on length scales considerably longer than the local cage scale are of primary importance in the deeply supercooled regime. The barrier hopping or segmental relaxation time is predicted to be a function primarily of a single parameter that is chemical structure, temperature, and pressure dependent. This parameter depends on the material-specific dimensionless amplitude of thermal density fluctuations (compressibility) and a reduced segmental density determined by the packing length and backbone characteristic ratio. Analytic results are derived for a crossover temperature T(c), collective barrier, and glass transition temperature T(g). The relation of these quantities to structural and thermodynamic properties of the polymer melt is established. A universal power-law scaling behavior of the relaxation time below T(c) is predicted based on identification of a reduced temperature variable that quantifies the breadth of the supercooled regime. Connections between the ratio T(c)/T(g), two measures of dynamic fragility, and the magnitude of the local relaxation time at T(g) logically follow. Excellent agreement with experiment is found for these generic aspects, and the crucial importance of the experimentally observed near universality of the dynamic crossover time is established. Extensions of the theory to treat the full chain dynamics, heterogeneity, barrier fluctuations, and nonpolymeric thermal glass forming liquids are briefly discussed.},

The numerical results are found to be in qualitative agreement with all the approximate analytic expressions previously derived with quantitative differences on the order of approximately 20-30\% or much less. The analytic prediction of a universal temperature dependence of the alpha relaxation time, and its intimate connection with the idea of a nearly universal crossover time, is established. Inter-relations between the breadth of the deeply supercooled regime, two definitions of the dynamic fragility, and the magnitude of the fast local Arrhenius process at the glass transition temperature are demonstrated and system-specific limitations identified. A quantitative application to segmental relaxation over 16 orders of magnitude in a polyvinylacetate melt yields encouraging results regarding the accuracy of the theory. The theoretical relaxation time results are well fit by multiple empirical forms (generally containing an assumed singular aspect) using parameters consistent with experimental studies. No physical significance is ascribed to this finding, but it does provide additional support for the temperature dependence of the alpha relaxation process predicted by the theory.},

The merit of SMS is that it does not require ensemble averaging, which is found in standard spectroscopic techniques. Thus SMS yields insight into complex fluctuation phenomena that cannot be observed using standard ensemble techniques. We investigate theoretical aspects of SMS, emphasizing (a) dynamical fluctuations (e.g., spectral diffusion, photon-counting statistics, antibunching, quantum jumps, triplet blinking, and nonergodic blinking) and (b) single-molecule fluctuations in disordered systems, specifically distribution of line shapes of single molecules in low-temperature glasses. Special emphasis is given to single-molecule systems that reveal surprising connections to Levy statistics (i.e., blinking of quantum dots and single molecules in glasses). We compare theory with experiment and mention open problems. Our work demonstrates that the theory of SMS is a complementary field of research for describing optical spectroscopy in the condensed phase.},

abstract = {Dissipation, the irreversible loss of energy and coherence, from a microsystem is the result of coupling to a much larger macrosystem (or reservoir) that is so large that one has no chance of keeping track of all of its degrees of freedom. The microsystem evolution is then described by tracing over the reservoir states, which results in an irreversible decay as excitation leaks out of the initially excited microsystems into the outer reservoir environment. Earlier treatments of this dissipation used density matrices to describe an ensemble of microsystems, either in the Schro dinger picture with master equations, or in the Heisenberg picture with Langevin equations. The development of experimental techniques to study single quantum systems (for example, single trapped ions, or cavity-radiation-field modes) has stimulated the construction of theoretical methods to describe individual realizations conditioned on a particular observation record of the decay channel. These methods, variously described as quantum-jump, Monte Carlo wave function, and quantum-trajectory methods, are the subject of this review article. We discuss their derivation, apply them to a number of current problems in quantum optics, and relate them to ensemble descriptions.},

In typical granular materials and foams, the thermal energy is too small to produce structural rearrangements. In this zero-temperature (T = 0) limit, multiple diverging and vanishing length scales characterize the approach to a sharp jamming transition. However, because thermal motion becomes relevant when the particles are small enough, it is imperative to understand how these length scales evolve as the temperature is increased. Here we used both colloidal experiments and computer simulations to progress beyond the zero-temperature limit to track one of the key parameters-the overlap distance between neighbouring particles-which vanishes at the T = 0 jamming transition. We find that this structural feature retains a vestige of its T = 0 behaviour and evolves in an unusual manner, which has masked its appearance until now. It is evident as a function of packing fraction at fixed temperature, but not as a function of temperature at fixed packing fraction or pressure. Our results conclusively demonstrate that length scales associated with the T = 0 jamming transition persist in thermal systems, not only in simulations but also in laboratory experiments.},

Some features of the four-point susceptibility chi(4) (t) are expected to be universal: at short times we expect a power-law increase in time as t(4) due to ballistic motion (t(2) if the dynamics is Brownian) followed by an elastic regime (most relevant deep in the glass phase) characterized by a t or sqrtt growth, depending on whether phonons are propagative or diffusive. We find in both the beta and early alpha regime that chi(4) approximately t(mu), where mu is directly related to the mechanism responsible for relaxation. This regime ends when a maximum of chi(4) is reached at a time t= t() of the order of the relaxation time of the system. This maximum is followed by a fast decay to zero at large times. The height of the maximum also follows a power law chi(4) (t()) approximately t(lambda). The value of the exponents mu and lambda allows one to distinguish between different mechanisms. For example, freely diffusing defects in d=3 lead to mu=2 and lambda=1 , whereas the CRR scenario rather predicts either mu=1 or a logarithmic behavior depending on the nature of the nucleation events and a logarithmic behavior of chi(4) (t()) . MCT leads to mu=b and lambda=1/gamma , where b and gamma are the standard MCT exponents. We compare our theoretical results with numerical simulations on a Lennard-Jones and a soft-sphere system. Within the limited time scales accessible to numerical simulations, we find that the exponent mu is rather small, mu<1 , with a value in reasonable agreement with the MCT predictions, but not with the prediction of simple diffusive defect models, KCM's with noncooperative defects, and CRR's. Experimental and numerical determination of chi(4) (t) for longer time scales and lower temperatures would yield highly valuable information on the glass formation mechanism.},

estimates of coexisting densities and critical-point parameters. We apply our
methods to study the liquid--vapor phase diagram of a particular mixture of
Lennard-Jones particles having a 10:1 size ratio. As the reservoir volume
fraction of small particles is increased in the range 0--5\%, the critical
temperature decreases by approximately 50\%, while the critical density drops by
some 30\%. These trends imply that in our system, adding small particles

@article{Karmakar2010,
abstract = {The effect of finite temperature \$T\$ and finite strain rate \$\backslash dot\backslash gamma\$ on the statistical physics of plastic deformations in amorphous solids made of \$N\$ particles is investigated. We recognize three regimes of temperature where the statistics are qualitatively different. In the first regime the temperature is very low, \$T<T\_\{\backslash rm cross\}(N)\$, and the strain is quasi-static. In this regime the elasto-plastic steady state exhibits highly correlated plastic events whose statistics are characterized by anomalous exponents. In the second regime \$T\_\{\backslash rm cross\}(N)<T<T\_\{\backslash rm max\}(\backslash dot\backslash gamma)\$ the system-size dependence of the stress fluctuations becomes normal, but the variance depends on the strain rate. The physical mechanism of the cross-over is different for increasing temperature and increasing strain rate, since the plastic events are still dominated by the mechanical instabilities (seen as an eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix going to zero), and the effect of temperature is only to facilitate the transition. A third regime occurs above the second cross-over temperature \$T\_\{\backslash rm max\}(\backslash dot\backslash gamma)\$ where stress fluctuations become dominated by thermal noise. Throughout the paper we demonstrate that scaling concepts are highly relevant for the problem at hand, and finally we present a scaling theory that is able to collapse the data for all the values of temperatures and strain rates, providing us with a high degree of predictability.},

abstract = {A statistical mechanical theory of collective dynamic barriers, slow segmental relaxation, and the glass transition of polymer melts is developed by combining, and in some aspects extending, methods of mode coupling, density functional, and activated hopping transport theories. A coarse-grained description of polymer chains is adopted and the melt is treated as a liquid of segments. The theory is built on the idea that collective density fluctuations on length scales considerably longer than the local cage scale are of primary importance in the deeply supercooled regime. The barrier hopping or segmental relaxation time is predicted to be a function primarily of a single parameter that is chemical structure, temperature, and pressure dependent. This parameter depends on the material-specific dimensionless amplitude of thermal density fluctuations (compressibility) and a reduced segmental density determined by the packing length and backbone characteristic ratio. Analytic results are derived for a crossover temperature T(c), collective barrier, and glass transition temperature T(g). The relation of these quantities to structural and thermodynamic properties of the polymer melt is established. A universal power-law scaling behavior of the relaxation time below T(c) is predicted based on identification of a reduced temperature variable that quantifies the breadth of the supercooled regime. Connections between the ratio T(c)/T(g), two measures of dynamic fragility, and the magnitude of the local relaxation time at T(g) logically follow. Excellent agreement with experiment is found for these generic aspects, and the crucial importance of the experimentally observed near universality of the dynamic crossover time is established. Extensions of the theory to treat the full chain dynamics, heterogeneity, barrier fluctuations, and nonpolymeric thermal glass forming liquids are briefly discussed.},

Inter-relations between the breadth of the deeply supercooled regime, two definitions of the dynamic fragility, and the magnitude of the fast local Arrhenius process at the glass transition temperature are demonstrated and system-specific limitations identified.

The theoretical relaxation time results are well fit by multiple empirical forms (generally containing an assumed singular aspect) using parameters consistent with experimental studies. No physical significance is ascribed to this finding, but it does provide additional support for the temperature dependence of the alpha relaxation process predicted by the theory.},
